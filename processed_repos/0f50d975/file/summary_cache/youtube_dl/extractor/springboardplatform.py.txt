- Purpose
  - A YouTube-DL extractor for Springboard Platform videos. It fetches video metadata and formats from Springboard’s RSS feed and exposes both HTTP and HLS (m3u8) formats.

- Key class
  - SpringboardPlatformIE(InfoExtractor)
    - _VALID_URL: Regex matching two URL patterns
      - previews or embed_iframe paths with index and video id
      - xml_feeds_advanced index/rss3 with video id
    - _TESTS: Includes a sample video (with md5) and several “only_matching” examples to validate URL patterns.
    - _extract_urls(webpage): Static method that scans a page for iframes loading embedded Springboard videos and returns their URLs. Used to discover additional entries from a page.
    - _real_extract(url): Main extraction logic
      - Parses video_id and index from the URL (from either the first or second URL pattern).
      - Downloads the RSS feed XML:
        http://cms.springboardplatform.com/xml_feeds_advanced/index/{index}/rss3/{video_id}
      - Navigates the RSS/ MRSS structure:
        - item = first <item>
        - content = MRSS <content> element, reads url attribute as video_url
        - title = unescaped <title> text
      - Validation: if video_url contains 'error_video.mp4', raise ExtractorError (video no longer exists)
      - Metadata extraction from content and item:
        - duration, bitrate (tbr), fileSize (filesize), width, height (from content attributes)
        - description (from item)
        - thumbnail (from MRSS <thumbnail> element)
        - timestamp (from a custom namespace element <created> under cms.springboardplatform.com)
      - Formats construction:
        - Primary HTTP format: url = video_url, with tbr, filesize, width, height, format_id='http'
        - HLS format derived from video_url:
          - Copy primary format and modify:
            - url = video_url host replaced: cdn. -> hls. and append .m3u8
            - ext = 'mp4'
            - format_id = 'hls'
            - protocol = 'm3u8_native'
        - Append HLS format to formats and sort
      - Return info dictionary:
        - id (video_id), title, description, thumbnail, timestamp, duration, formats

- Important implementation details
  - Uses RSS/MRSS payload (XML feed) to obtain video data rather than parsing the page directly.
  - Handles multiple namespaces:
    - MRSS content and thumbnail elements
    - A custom namespace for the created timestamp to compute upload date
  - Robust metadata parsing with helper utilities:
    - int_or_none, unescapeHTML, xpath_text, xpath_attr, xpath_element, unified_timestamp
  - Video availability check via explicit error URL check ('error_video.mp4')
  - Generates two formats per video: a direct HTTP/MP4 and a secondary HLS (m3u8) version by transforming the video URL host and appending .m3u8
  - _extract_urls helps discover embedded Springboard videos from pages containing iframes pointing to embed_iframe URLs

- Overall functionality
  - Enables YouTube-DL to extract Springboard Platform videos by leveraging the index/video RSS feed, gather metadata, and expose both HTTP and HLS formats with proper titles, descriptions, timestamps, and thumbnails.
