Hereâ€™s a concise, structured summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/presstv.py.

Overview
- Implements a YouTube-DL extractor for PressTV video pages.
- Subclasses InfoExtractor and provides logic to locate video formats and metadata from a PressTV detail page.

Key components
- Class: PressTVIE(InfoExtractor)
- URL pattern (_VALID_URL): 
  - Matches URLs like http(s)://www.presstv.ir/Detail/YYYY/MM/DD/{id}/[optional-display-id]
  - Captures:
    - y: year
    - m: month
    - d: day
    - id: video id
    - display_id: optional slug after id
- Test data (_TEST): Demonstrates extraction for a sample PressTV URL, including expected id, display_id, extension, title, upload_date, thumbnail, and description.

Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
- URL parsing:
  - Uses the _VALID_URL regex to extract video_id (from id) and display_id (or falls back to video_id).
- Webpage retrieval:
  - Downloads the page with _download_webpage(url, display_id).
- Video URL extraction:
  - Retrieves the real video URL from a hidden input named inpPlayback via _hidden_inputs(webpage)['inpPlayback'].
- Formats construction:
  - Base playback URL: http://192.99.219.222:82/presstv
  - Source patterns are defined as _formats with pairs of (height, extension):
    - (180, '_low200.mp4')
    - (360, '_low400.mp4')
    - (720, '_low800.mp4')
    - (1080, '.mp4')
  - Each format URL is built as base_url + video_url_without_last_4_chars + extension (video_url[:-4] removes the trailing .mp4 before appending the new suffix).
  - Resulting formats have:
    - url: composed URL
    - format_id: e.g., "180p", "360p", "720p", "1080p"
    - height: numeric height (180, 360, 720, 1080)
- Metadata extraction:
  - Title: from HTML meta tag using _html_search_meta('title', ...) and stripping a leading 'PressTV-' with remove_start.
  - Thumbnail: via _og_search_thumbnail(webpage)
  - Description: via _og_search_description(webpage)
  - Upload date: constructed from URL components y,m,d into YYYYMMDD
- Return dictionary:
  - id: video_id
  - display_id: display_id (or video_id if missing)
  - title: extracted and cleaned title
  - formats: list of constructed formats
  - thumbnail: extracted thumbnail URL
  - upload_date: formatted upload date
  - description: extracted OpenGraph description

Important implementation details
- Uses remove_start to clean the title prefix 'PressTV-'.
- Relies on a specific playback mechanism described in playback.js on PressTV (hence the hard-coded base URL and format suffixes).
- The display_id is optional in the URL; if absent, video_id is used as display_id.
- The code does not perform any MD5-based validation itself; the _TEST includes an md5 for the result (as per the test framework).

In short, PressTVIE parses a PressTV detail page, fetches a hidden playback URL, builds multiple video formats from a base server by adjusting the file suffix, and extracts title, thumbnail, description, and upload date to return a structured video entry.
