Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/samplefocus.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for samples hosted on samplefocus.com, enabling extraction of metadata and the audio URL (MP3) for a given sample page.

- Main class
  - SampleFocusIE (inherits from InfoExtractor)

- URL pattern and tests
  - _VALID_URL matches https://www.samplefocus.com/samples/{id}
  - _TESTS includes:
    - A fully fleshed example with expected fields (id, display_id, ext, title, thumbnail, license, uploader, uploader_id, like_count, comment_count, categories) and a specific MD5 for the MP3.
    - Two additional tests with only_matching to ensure URL matching works for other sample pages.

- Core extraction flow (_real_extract)
  - Display ID and page content:
    - Determines display_id via _match_id and downloads the webpage with _download_webpage.
  - Sample ID:
    - Extracts the numeric sample_id from an input tag with id="sample_id" and its value attribute.
  - Title:
    - Tries OpenGraph title via _og_search_title; if not found, falls back to an HTML <h1> extraction.
  - MP3 URL:
    - Tries to extract an MP3 URL from an input tag with id="sample_mp3" and its value (via a non-greedy pattern). If not found, attempts to read a contentUrl via a meta tag (itemprop="contentUrl") and then uses extract_attributes to fetch the content value.
  - Thumbnail:
    - Uses the OpenGraph thumbnail if available; otherwise attempts to extract a waveform image URL from an <img> tag with class "waveform responsive-img".
  - Comments:
    - Parses comments with a regex targeting author blocks and corresponding body text. Builds a list of dicts with author, author_id, and text.
  - Uploader info:
    - Attempts to parse uploader_id and uploader from a line like “By <a href="/users/{id}">Name</a>”.
  - Categories (breadcrumb):
    - Finds a BreadcrumbList block and extracts category names from spans with property="name".
  - Like and comment counts:
    - Helper function extract_count reads numeric counts from spans with a count class (e.g., sample-{id}-favorites for likes, comments for comments).
  - License:
    - Attempts to extract the license text from a link to /license within the page.
  - Return value:
    - A dictionary including:
      - id, title, url (MP3 URL), display_id, thumbnail, uploader, license, uploader_id, like_count, comment_count, comments, categories

- Key implementation details
  - Uses several utility helpers: extract_attributes, get_element_by_attribute, int_or_none.
  - Robust parsing with multiple fallbacks and fatal flags:
    - mp3 URL and license extraction use fatal=False to tolerate missing fields.
  - Regex-driven parsing:
    - Carefully crafted patterns to pull numeric IDs, URLs, and structured content (comments, categories) from HTML.
  - Data shaping:
    - Returns a clean dictionary aligned with youtube-dl’s expected InfoExtractor output, suitable for downstream formatting and storage.

Overall, this extractor focuses on assembling a complete set of metadata for a sample on samplefocus.com, plus the direct MP3 URL, while handling possible variations or missing fields gracefully.
