- Purpose: TheStarIE is a YouTube-dl extractor for The Star (thestar.com). It does not download the video itself but delegates to Brightcove since The Star uses Brightcove as its video player.

- Class and inheritance:
  - TheStarIE extends InfoExtractor from youtube_dl.extractor.common.

- URL matching:
  - _VALID_URL regex: r'https?://(?:www\.)?thestar\.com/(?:[^/]+/)*(?P<id>.+)\.html'
  - Captures the article-specific ID (the path after the domain up to .html) as the display_id.

- Testing data:
  - _TEST provides a sample The Star URL and expected metadata, including:
    - id: 4732393888001
    - ext: mp4
    - title, description, uploader_id, timestamp, upload_date
  - params specifies skip_download: True to avoid downloading the video during tests (m3u8 download is not performed in the test).

- Brightcove integration:
  - BRIGHTCOVE_URL_TEMPLATE = 'http://players.brightcove.net/794267642001/default_default/index.html?videoId=%s'
  - The extractor finds the Brightcove video ID from the article page content using a regex:
    - r'mainartBrightcoveVideoId["\']?\s*:\s*["\']?(\d+)'
  - After obtaining the Brightcove ID, it constructs the Brightcove URL and returns a URL result linked to the BrightcoveNew extractor.

- Core extraction flow (_real_extract):
  1. Derive display_id from the URL using _match_id(url).
  2. Download the article page with _download_webpage(url, display_id).
  3. Extract the Brightcove video ID with _search_regex.
  4. Return a URL result pointing to the BrightcoveNew extractor using the constructed URL and brightcove_id as the display_id.

- Implementation notes:
  - The extractor relies on Brightcove for actual video metadata and download (hence the BrightcoveNew backend).
  - The approach is lightweight: fetch page, parse a single Brightcove ID, delegate to BrightcoveNew.
  - Uses Python 2/3 compatibility features (unicode_literals, etc.).
