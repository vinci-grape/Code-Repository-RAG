Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/people.py

- Purpose:
  - Implement an extractor for People.com video pages that delegates actual video extraction to Brightcove (BrightcoveNew).

- Core class and inheritance:
  - PeopleIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL pattern:
  - _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?people\.com/people/videos/0,,(?P<id>\d+),00\.html'
  - Matches People.com video pages of the form .../videos/0,,<id>,00.html
  - Extracts the numeric video id as group "id"

- Test data (_TEST):
  - Provides a sample URL and expected metadata such as:
    - id: 'ref:20995451'
    - ext: 'mp4'
    - title, description, thumbnail, duration, timestamp, upload_date, uploader_id
  - Specifies skip_download: True
  - add_ie: ['BrightcoveNew'] (indicating delegation to BrightcoveNew extractor)

- Main functionality (_real_extract):
  - Obtains the video id using self._match_id(url)
  - Constructs a Brightcove URL:
    http://players.brightcove.net/416418724/default_default/index.html?videoId=ref:<id>
  - Returns a URL result pointing to the BrightcoveNew extractor:
    self.url_result('<constructed URL>', 'BrightcoveNew')

- Key implementation details:
  - The extractor does not fetch or parse metadata itself; it delegates to BrightcoveNew by constructing the Brightcove player URL with videoId=ref:<id>.
  - The 'ref:' prefix in the id aligns with Brightcoveâ€™s video reference format used in the URL.
  - The test demonstrates expected metadata that will be populated by BrightcoveNew after delegation.

- Overall behavior:
  - When a People video page is encountered, this extractor redirects to Brightcove's player URL for the given video, leveraging BrightcoveNew to retrieve the actual video information and media.
