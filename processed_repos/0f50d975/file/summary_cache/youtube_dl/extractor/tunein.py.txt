Summary of the file: ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/tunein.py

What it does
- Provides a set of extractors for TuneIn content within youtube-dl. It fetches metadata and audio streams via TuneInâ€™s API, builds a list of available formats, handles live content, and returns standard youtube-dl info dictionaries.

Main components

1) TuneInBaseIE (base extractor)
- Inherits from InfoExtractor.
- _API_BASE_URL: Base API endpoint for TuneIn metadata.
- _extract_urls(webpage): Static helper that finds TuneIn embed player iframe URLs in a page via a regex. Targets embed/player/[pst]\d+ iframes.
- _real_extract(url):
  - Derives content_id from the URL.
  - Downloads JSON metadata from API_BASE_URL + content-specific query (defined by _API_URL_QUERY in subclasses).
  - Extracts Title, Logo (thumbnail), Location, and StreamUrl.
  - If no StreamUrl is provided, raises ExtractorError.
  - If StreamUrl is relative, resolves to absolute with urljoin.
  - Downloads stream data from streams_url (JSONP-like wrapper cleaned via a transform to strip surrounding parentheses).
  - Iterates over Streams to build per-stream format dictionaries:
    - is_live: set True if any stream has Type == 'Live'.
    - reliability: used to generate a format_note and to set a priority (preference 0 if reliability is None or > 90, else 1).
    - format fields:
      - abr: Bandwidth
      - ext: MediaType lowercased
      - acodec: MediaType
      - vcodec: 'none' (audio-only)
      - url: stream URL
      - source_preference: reliability
      - format_note: "Reliability: X%" if reliability available
  - Sorts formats with _sort_formats.
  - Returns an info dict with:
    - id: content_id
    - title: uses _live_title(title) if is_live is True
    - formats: list of formats
    - thumbnail: Logo
    - location: Location
    - is_live: boolean flag

2) TuneInClipIE (clip content)
- IE_NAME: 'tunein:clip'
- _VALID_URL matches TuneIn audio clips: .../station/...audioClipId=<id>
- _API_URL_QUERY: '?tuneType=AudioClip&audioclipId=%s'
- _TESTS: example clip with id 816, expecting mp3.

3) TuneInStationIE (station content)
- IE_NAME: 'tunein:station'
- _VALID_URL matches various station/embed URLs that include a StationId.
- _API_URL_QUERY: '?tuneType=Station&stationId=%s'
- suitable(cls, url): ensures Clip tests are preferred first; returns False if URL matches TuneInClipIE.suitable(url), otherwise uses base suitability.
- _TESTS: examples for a live station (skip_download) and an embed/player URL (only_matching).

4) TuneInProgramIE (program content)
- IE_NAME: 'tunein:program'
- _VALID_URL matches program-related URLs including embed player
- _API_URL_QUERY: '?tuneType=Program&programId=%s'
- _TESTS: examples for a live program and an embed/player URL (only_matching).

5) TuneInTopicIE (topic content)
- IE_NAME: 'tunein:topic'
- _VALID_URL matches topic URLs and embed player URLs with TopicId
- _API_URL_QUERY: '?tuneType=Topic&topicId=%s'
- _TESTS: example topic and an embed/player URL (only_matching).

6) TuneInShortenerIE (URL shortener)
- IE_NAME: 'tunein:shortener'
- IE_DESC: False (not listed)
- _VALID_URL matches tun.in short URLs
- _TEST: redirect example (short URL resolving to an actual TuneIn page)
- _real_extract(url):
  - Extracts the short path id via _match_id.
  - Performs a request to follow the redirect (no HEAD support on server).
  - Reads final URL from the redirect response.
  - Logs the redirected URL and returns self.url_result(final_url) to allow subsequent extraction by other extractors.

Key implementation details
- Content retrieval:
  - Uses _download_json to fetch content metadata and stream data.
  - Streams data may come wrapped (e.g., JSONP-like) and is cleaned with a transform_source function that strips surrounding parentheses.
- URL handling:
  - Relative stream URLs are resolved against the original content URL with urljoin.
- Formats:
  - Built as a list of dictionaries with fields: url, ext, abr, acodec, vcodec, format_note, source_preference, and a user-facing preference to influence sorting.
  - live streams are detected by a stream with Type == 'Live' and reflected in the final title via _live_title.
- Prioritization:
  - Preference is 0 for high reliability (reliability > 90) or unknown; otherwise 1.
  - _sort_formats is called to order formats logically (e.g., higher quality first when available).
- Live handling:
  - If any stream is live, is_live is True and the title may be modified with _live_title.
- Shortener:
  - Short URLs are resolved to their final destination before extraction.

Overall purpose
- The module provides a set of extractors for different TuneIn content types (clips, stations, programs, topics) and a short URL resolver. It centralizes the logic to fetch TuneIn metadata and stream URLs, construct compatible youtube-dl format entries, handle live content, and return standard, rich information for downstream processing.
