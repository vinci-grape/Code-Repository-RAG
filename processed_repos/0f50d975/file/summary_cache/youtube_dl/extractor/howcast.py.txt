Summary:

- Purpose
  - HowcastIE extracts Howcast videos by delegating to the Ooyala extractor. It locates the Ooyala embed code on a Howcast page and returns a transparent URL to the Ooyala backend.

- Class and inheritance
  - HowcastIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL matching
  - _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?howcast\.com/videos/(?P<id>\d+)'
  - Matches Howcast video pages like http(s)://www.howcast.com/videos/390161

- Test data
  - _TEST includes a sample Howcast URL, expected md5, and an info_dict with:
    - id, ext (mp4), title, description (md5), timestamp, upload_date, duration
    - skip_download: True
    - add_ie: ['Ooyala'] to indicate delegation to the Ooyala extractor

- Core functionality (_real_extract)
  - Extracts video_id from the URL using _match_id.
  - Downloads the webpage with _download_webpage.
  - Finds the Ooyala embed code by searching for an iframe src containing embed_code via:
    r'<iframe[^>]+src="[^"]+\bembed_code=([^\b]+)\b'
    using _search_regex.
  - Constructs a transparent URL to the Ooyala extractor: url = 'ooyala:%s' % embed_code.
  - Returns a dictionary with:
    - _type: 'url_transparent' (delegate to another extractor)
    - ie_key: 'Ooyala'
    - url: the constructed Ooyala URL
    - id: video_id
    - timestamp: parsed via parse_iso8601 from the article:published_time meta tag (found using _html_search_meta on the page)

- Important implementation details
  - Uses a transparent wrapper (_type: 'url_transparent') so the actual video metadata is retrieved by the Ooyala extractor.
  - The embed_code is extracted from the iframe/src query parameter, which is how Howcast provides the actual video asset via Ooyala.
  - The timestamp is derived from the pageâ€™s article:published_time meta tag and converted to a Unix timestamp with parse_iso8601.
  - The code relies on the Ooyala extractor (added in _TEST via add_ie) to fetch the final video information (title, duration, etc.).

- Dependencies
  - Depends on Ooyala extractor for the final media retrieval.
  - Uses utilities: parse_iso8601 and common InfoExtractor base class.
