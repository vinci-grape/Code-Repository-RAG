Here’s a concise, focused summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/aenetworks.py.

Overview
- Provides YouTube-DL extractors for A&E Networks portals (History, A&E, Lifetime, FYI, Biography, History Vault).
- Core media retrieval is built around ThePlatform (ThePlatformIE) with behind-the-wall (MVPD) support.
- Also includes GraphQL-based playlist/collection/show extractors for some sections (History Vault, etc.).
- Handles geo-restrictions and behind-wall authentication when needed.
- Contains dedicated extractors for individual topics/players and for Biography pages that embed History players.

Key classes and main functionality

1) AENetworksBaseIE (base class)
- Inherits from ThePlatformIE.
- Constants:
  - _BASE_URL_REGEX: flexible URL matching for multiple A&E domains (history.com, aetv.com, mylifetime.com, lifetimemovieclub.com, fyi.tv, historyvault.com, biography.com, etc.).
  - _THEPLATFORM_KEY / _THEPLATFORM_SECRET: credentials used to sign ThePlatform URLs.
  - _DOMAIN_MAP: maps domain hostnames to a pair (brand, slug) used to query A&E feeds (e.g., history.com -> ('HISTORY','history'), aetv.com -> ('AETV','aetv'), etc.). Some domains map to (None, slug) if the brand is not needed.
- _extract_aen_smil(self, smil_url, video_id, auth=None)
  - Builds several ThePlatform SMIL URLs by augmenting the base SMIL URL with different query variants (assetTypes and switches like hls_high_ak, hls_high_fastly, etc.).
  - Signs each URL, fetches ThePlatform SMIL data via _extract_theplatform_smil, and aggregates formats and subtitles.
  - Supports behind-wall auth: if a request fails with a non-Geo error, it stores the last error and continues trying other variants; if only errors occur and no formats were gathered, re-raises the last error.
  - Returns a dict with id, formats, and subtitles, after sorting formats.
- _extract_aetn_info(self, domain, filter_key, filter_value, url)
  - Uses the domain to determine requestor_id and brand from _DOMAIN_MAP.
  - Loads the A&E feed JSON for videos via feeds.video.aetnd.com/api/v2/{brand}/videos with a filter.
  - Selects the relevant result (first item where filter_key matches filter_value).
  - If not found, raises an ExtractorError indicating the show is not in the A&E feed.
  - Extracts title, video_id, and media_url (public URL).
  - Fetches ThePlatform metadata for the video (path extracted from media_url).
  - Parses ThePlatform metadata to a local info dict; if behind a wall, builds MVPD auth via _get_mvpd_resource and _extract_mvpd_auth.
  - Merges ThePlatform SMIL formats via _extract_aen_smil and adds title, series, season/episode numbers to the info.
  - Returns a dict with all merged metadata.

2) AENetworksIE
- Entry-point extractor for most A&E networks.
- IE_NAME = 'aenetworks'.
- _VALID_URL: combines _BASE_URL_REGEX with patterns for shows, movies, etc.
- _TESTS: includes examples for History, A&E, and other domains; demonstrates geo-restriction and behind-wall behavior; also contains several only_matching entries for non-extractable pages.
- _real_extract(self, url)
  - Extracts domain and canonical path, then delegates to _extract_aetn_info(domain, 'canonical', '/' + canonical, url).

3) AENetworksListBaseIE
- Abstract base for GraphQL-based playlists:
  - _call_api(self, resource, slug, brand, fields)
    - Calls GraphQL endpoint https://yoga.appsvcs.aetnd.com/graphql with:
      - brand as a query param
      - a GraphQL query built from resource, slug, and fields
    - Returns data[resource].
  - _real_extract(self, url)
    - Extracts domain and slug; derives brand from _DOMAIN_MAP.
    - Calls _call_api with the class’ _RESOURCE, slug, brand, and _FIELDS.
    - Builds a list of video entries by iterating playlist[self._ITEMS_KEY]; for each item:
      - Gets a document via _get_doc(item); uses canonical to build the video URL: base_url + canonical.
      - Creates a YouTube-DL result for AENetworksIE with that URL and the doc's id.
    - Optionally attaches a playlist description from _PLAYLIST_DESCRIPTION_KEY.
    - Returns a playlist_result with id, title, and description.

4) AENetworksCollectionIE
- Inherits AENetworksListBaseIE.
- IE_NAME = 'aenetworks:collection'.
- _VALID_URL matches collection/list URLs.
- Uses:
  - _RESOURCE = 'list'
  - _ITEMS_KEY = 'items'
  - _PLAYLIST_TITLE_KEY = 'display_title'
  - _FIELDS with collection structure
  - _get_doc(item) returns item.get('doc') or {}
- Purpose: extract a collection of videos from a History Vault/related collection page via GraphQL.

5) AENetworksShowIE
- Inherits AENetworksListBaseIE.
- IE_NAME = 'aenetworks:show'.
- _VALID_URL matches shows/... URLs.
- Uses:
  - _RESOURCE = 'series'
  - _ITEMS_KEY = 'episodes'
  - _PLAYLIST_TITLE_KEY = 'title'
  - _PLAYLIST_DESCRIPTION_KEY = 'description'
  - _FIELDS includes series and episodes (canonical, id)
  - _get_doc(item) returns item directly
- Purpose: extract a show’s episodes as a playlist.

6) HistoryTopicIE
- IE_NAME = 'history:topic', description for History.com topic pages.
- _VALID_URL matches History topic pages ending with -video.
- _real_extract(url)
  - Derives display_id from URL and redirects to the History video page:
    http://www.history.com/videos/{display_id}
  - Returns a result that uses AENetworksIE as the underlying extractor (via url_result) to fetch the actual video.

7) HistoryPlayerIE
- IE_NAME = 'history:player'
- _VALID_URL matches History player URLs: history or biography domain, /player/{id}
- _real_extract(url)
  - Extracts domain and video_id from the URL.
  - Delegates to _extract_aetn_info(domain, 'id', video_id, url) to fetch metadata and ThePlatform SMIL formats.

8) BiographyIE
- For Biography videos that embed History players.
- _VALID_URL matches biography.com/video/{id}
- _TESTS includes a sample Biography video.
- _real_extract(url)
  - Gets display_id from URL, downloads the page.
  - Locates an embedded player URL with a regex that points to HistoryPlayerIE’s _VALID_URL.
  - Returns a result using HistoryPlayerIE to extract the actual video.

Implementation details and notable behavior
- ThePlatform integration:
  - ThePlatform SMIL URLs are signed with _THEPLATFORM_KEY/SECRET before fetching formats.
  - _extract_aen_smil tries multiple asset types and HLS/DASH switches (M3U, MPEG-DASH, etc.) to assemble a complete set of formats and subtitles.
  - GeoRestrictedError handling: if a particular SMIL variant is geo-restricted, it’s skipped (unless all variants fail, in which case the last error bubbles up).
- Behind-wall (MVPD) support:
  - When ThePlatform metadata indicates a behind-wall resource, MVPD authentication is obtained via _get_mvpd_resource and _extract_mvpd_auth using A&E-specific identifiers from the metadata.
- GraphQL-based playlist extraction:
  - For collections and shows, the code queries a GraphQL API (yoga.appsvcs.aetnd.com) with fields tailored to the item type, then reconstructs playable video URLs from canonical paths.
- Domain-aware logic:
  - _DOMAIN_MAP guides how different domains are treated (brand slug, feed endpoints, etc.).
  - History Vault, Biography, and History topics have specialized paths to map to standard ThePlatform-based extraction or to History video pages.
- Output structure:
  - Standard ThePlatform-based videos: dicts with id, formats, and possibly subtitles; for playlists: playlist entries as url_results, plus id, title, and description.

In short
- This file provides a robust extractor set for A&E Networks using ThePlatform for media delivery, with support for geo-restricted and behind-wall content, plus GraphQL-driven playlist/collection handling for several sites. It includes specialized handling for History topics/players and Biography pages that embed History content, and uses a combination of ThePlatform SMIL extraction and MVPD authentication when needed.
