Here is a concise but comprehensive summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/rumble.py:

- Purpose
  - Implement an information extractor (InfoExtractor) for Rumble embed pages. It fetches video metadata via Rumbleâ€™s embedJS API and builds a list of playable formats along with associated metadata (title, timestamps, thumbnails, channel info, etc.).

- Key class
  - RumbleEmbedIE (subclass of InfoExtractor)

- URL validation and tests
  - _VALID_URL regex:
    - Matches rumble.com embed pages of the form:
      - https://rumble.com/embed/{id}
      - with an optional subcomponent like a version (e.g., embed/v5pv5f or embed/ufe9n.v5pv5f)
  - _TESTS:
    - Test 1: embeds/v5pv5f, expects mp4 format, specific title, timestamp, and upload_date.
    - Test 2: a similar URL with a dot-based variant, marked only_matching for regex verification.

- Core functionality (_real_extract)
  - video_id extraction:
    - video_id = self._match_id(url)
  - Data retrieval:
    - Fetch video metadata via https://rumble.com/embedJS/ with query parameters:
      - request = 'video'
      - v = video_id
    - Uses self._download_json(...) to obtain a JSON object (video)
  - Title:
    - title = video['title']
  - Formats construction:
    - Initialize formats = []
    - Iterate over video.get('ua') (or {} to avoid None):
      - For each height, ua (where height is the key and ua is a dict with URLs and bitrates):
        - For i in range(2) (two potential URLs per height):
          - f_url = ua[i] (safe access with try_get)
          - If f_url exists:
            - ext = determine_ext(f_url)
            - f format dict:
              - 'ext': ext
              - 'format_id': "{ext}-{height}p" (e.g., "mp4-720p")
              - 'height': int_or_none(height)
              - 'url': f_url
            - bitrate = ua[i + 2]['bitrate'] if present (safely via try_get)
            - If bitrate exists, set f['tbr'] = int_or_none(bitrate)
            - Append f to formats
    - self._sort_formats(formats) to order formats by quality/bitrate
  - Additional metadata:
    - author = video.get('author') or {}
    - thumbnail = video.get('i')
    - timestamp = parse_iso8601(video.get('pubDate'))
    - channel = author.get('name')
    - channel_url = author.get('url')
    - duration = int_or_none(video.get('duration'))
  - Return dictionary:
    - id: video_id
    - title: title
    - formats: formats
    - thumbnail: thumbnail
    - timestamp: timestamp
    - channel: channel
    - channel_url: channel_url
    - duration: duration

- Important implementation details
  - Uses embedJS API with parameters: request=video, v=video_id to obtain a structured JSON containing available formats.
  - Formats are built from the video['ua'] mapping, which appears to provide two URLs per height and corresponding bitrates located at indices i+2.
  - Safe access patterns (try_get) and helper utilities (determine_ext, int_or_none, parse_iso8601) are used to robustly extract and normalize data.
  - The format_id convention is ext-height with a trailing 'p' (e.g., mp4-720p).
  - Handles potential absence of video data gracefully with defaults (e.g., video.get('ua') or {}).

- Output structure
  - A dict containing:
    - id, title, formats (list), thumbnail, timestamp (seconds since epoch), channel, channel_url, duration (seconds)

This extractor focuses on converting Rumble embed metadata into a standard YouTube-dl compatible format list, including multiple video formats and associated metadata.
