Summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/storyfire.py

Purpose
- Implement a set of extractors for the StoryFire site to retrieve video data and expose the actual video via Vimeo.

Main classes
- StoryFireBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Shared helpers and common logic used by all StoryFire extractors.
  - _VALID_URL_BASE: base URL pattern for StoryFire.
  - _call_api(path, video_id, resource, query=None)
    - Calls StoryFire app API at https://storyfire.com/app/<path>/<video_id> and returns the parsed JSON.
    - Uses the resource string for the status message during download.
  - _parse_video(video)
    - Converts a StoryFire video object into a youtube-dl usable entry.
    - Extracts a Vimeo ID from video['vimeoVideoURL'] via regex.
    - Returns a url_transparent entry pointing to the Vimeo URL, with a Referer header of https://storyfire.com/ (smuggled to preserve headers).
    - Collects and returns metadata: title, description, thumbnail, view/like/comment counts, duration, timestamp, uploader info, and episode_number.
    - Other format extraction is currently commented out (no direct extraction of HLS/DASH formats).

- StoryFireIE (video-details)
  - _VALID_URL: base + video-details/<24-hex-id>
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts the internal video_id from the URL.
    - Fetches video metadata via _call_api('generic/video-detail', ...), accessing the 'video' field.
    - Delegates to _parse_video to produce the final entry.

- StoryFireUserIE (user videos)
  - _VALID_URL: base + user/<id>/video
  - _PAGE_SIZE: 20
  - _fetch_page(user_id, page)
    - Calls _call_api('publicVideos', user_id, 'page N', with skip offset) to fetch a page of videos.
    - Parses and yields each video using _parse_video.
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts the user_id from the URL.
    - Builds an OnDemandPagedList over pages of results (paging function is _fetch_page).
    - Returns a playlist_result built from the paged entries.

- StoryFireSeriesIE (series stories)
  - _VALID_URL: base + write/series/stories/<id>
  - _extract_videos(stories)
    - Iterates through stories; yields parsed videos for those with hasVideo set.
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts series_id from the URL.
    - Fetches series stories via _call_api('seriesStories', series_id, 'series stories').
    - Returns a playlist_result from the parsed videos.

Key implementation details
- Video extraction model:
  - All video entries ultimately point to a Vimeo video page (via _parse_video returning a url_transparent with a Vimeo URL and a Referer header).
  - Actual video formats are not downloaded directly from StoryFire; the extractor relies on Vimeo to provide the media.
  - The Referer header is set to storyfire.com to help with Vimeo access protections.

- Metadata handling:
  - Uses int_or_none to robustly coerce numeric fields (views, likes, comments, duration, timestamp, episode_number).
  - Includes uploader information and uploader URL when available.
  - Provides standard fields such as id, title, description, thumbnail, duration, timestamp, and counts.

- API interaction:
  - Centralized API access via _call_api, pointing to https://storyfire.com/app/{path}/{video_id} with optional query parameters.
  - For video-details, the API returns a dict with a 'video' key containing necessary metadata.
  - For users and series, additional endpoints return lists of videos or stories, which are parsed page-by-page.

- Pagination and playlists:
  - User videos use OnDemandPagedList to lazily load pages of results (PAGE_SIZE = 20).
  - Series videos are collected by iterating over the returned stories and selecting those with hasVideo.

Tests and notes
- StoryFireIE test demonstrates parsing of a video-details URL and returning a Vimeo-backed entry with expected metadata.
- StoryFireUserIE test shows pagination behavior and playlist creation.
- StoryFireSeriesIE tests cover series with multiple videos and a case with zero videos.
- Some formatting code (HLS/DASH) is present but commented out, indicating an intended but not implemented direct format extraction from StoryFire; current behavior defers to Vimeo.

In short
- This file provides a cohesive set of extractors for StoryFire:
  - Video details → Vimeo-based entry with rich metadata.
  - User’s video feed → paginated playlist of parsed videos.
  - Series’ stories → playlist of videos within a series.
- It relies on the StoryFire app API for data and uses Vimeo as the actual video source, with careful handling of HTTP Referer headers.
