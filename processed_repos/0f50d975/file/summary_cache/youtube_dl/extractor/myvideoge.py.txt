Concise but comprehensive summary of the code

What it is:
- A YouTube-DL (youtube_dl) extractor for the Georgian video site myvideo.ge.
- Implemented as MyVideoGeIE, a subclass of InfoExtractor.

Main functionality:
- Extracts video metadata and formats from a MyVideoGe page and returns a structured info dictionary compatible with youtube-dl.

Key components and methods:
- _VALID_URL: Regex to match video pages of the form https://www.myvideo.ge/v/<id> (id is numeric).
- _real_extract(url): Core extraction logic.
  - video_id: Captured from the URL using _match_id.
  - webpage: Full HTML content fetched via _download_webpage.
  - title: Resolved from OpenGraph (og:title) first, then an element with class my_video_title, or the HTML <title> tag as fallback.
  - jwplayer_sources: Attempts to locate JWPlayer initialization for mvplayer and its sources (JSON-like array) in the page. Uses a complex regex to grab the sources array, then converts it to JSON with js_to_json.
  - formats: Generated by _parse_jwplayer_formats(jwplayer_sources, video_id). If no sources found, formats is treated as an empty list.
  - For each format, sets a preference using a _quality mapping (SD <-> HD) via format_id. Then sorts formats with _sort_formats.
  - description: Sourced from OpenGraph description, or a DOM element with id long_desc_holder, or a meta description tag.
  - uploader: Extracted from an anchor with class mv_user_name (optional).
  - upload_date: Taken from an element with class mv_vid_upl_date. If the date is in Georgian (ka) locale, converts months to English equivalents before passing to unified_strdate.
  - thumbnail: Obtained via OpenGraph thumbnail helper.
  - view_count, like_count, dislike_count: Extracted via specific page elements (views by class mv_vid_views, likes/dislikes by ids likes_count and dislikes_count) and converted to integers when possible.

Important implementation details:
- JWPlayer integration:
  - The code looks for a JWPlayer setup call: jwplayer('mvplayer').setup(... sources: [...] ...).
  - The sources array is parsed with _parse_json and transform_source=js_to_json to handle JavaScript-style JSON.
- Format handling:
  - _quality is a static method wrapping qualities(('SD','HD')), ensuring formats get a numeric preference value based on their format_id (e.g., 'SD' or 'HD').
  - Formats are sorted after assigning preferences to present higher quality first when available.
- Localization handling:
  - Georgian month names are defined in _MONTH_NAMES_KA.
  - If upload_date contains a Georgian month, the code maps it to the corresponding English month using MONTH_NAMES['en'] and the index of the Georgian month, then uses unified_strdate to convert to a standard date string (YYYYMMDD).
- Robustness:
  - Many fields are optional; the code uses fatal=False in several lookups (e.g., uploader, jwplayer_sources) to avoid failing extraction if information is missing.
  - If jwplayer_sources cannot be found, formats defaults to an empty list (handled gracefully to avoid crashes).

Returned info dictionary:
- id: video_id
- title: resolved title
- description: resolved description
- uploader: optional uploader name
- formats: list of available formats with URLs and metadata, sorted by quality
- thumbnail: OpenGraph thumbnail
- upload_date: date in YYYYMMDD format (if parsed)
- view_count: integer or None
- like_count: integer or None
- dislike_count: integer or None

Tests:
- _TEST contains a sample URL, expected MD5, and info_dict for a typical extraction, plus a skip note indicating CI blockers on the site.
