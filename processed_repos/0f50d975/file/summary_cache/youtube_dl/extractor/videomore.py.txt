Below is a concise but comprehensive summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/videomore.py.

Overview
- Purpose: Implement YouTube-dl extractors for Videomore/More.tv content. Handles videos, embeds and seasons by querying the More.tv/Videomore APIs and extracting available streaming formats (DASH, HLS, MSS).

Key Classes
1) VideomoreBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
- Purpose: Shared base for Videomore-related extractors.
- Constants:
  - _API_BASE_URL = 'https://more.tv/api/v3/web/'
  - _VALID_URL_BASE = r'https?://(?:videomore\.ru|more\.tv)/'
- Helpers:
  - _download_page_data(display_id)
    - Calls API_BASE_URL + 'PageData' with query param url = '/' + display_id.
    - Returns attributes.response.data from the JSON.
  - _track_url_result(track)
    - Reads trackVod from a track, chooses video_url from playerLink or link.
    - Returns a url_result pointing to VideomoreIE with hubId as the third param.

2) VideomoreIE (InfoExtractor)
- IE_NAME = 'videomore'
- _VALID_URL: Complex pattern covering multiple Videomore/More.tv player configurations, including embedded players, siren.more.tv, and odysseus paths. Also matches when track_id is present.
- _TESTS: Includes multiple test cases for videos, seasons, embeds, and various track/pointer URLs (some expected to raise or be skipped).
- _GEO_BYPASS = False
- _extract_url(webpage) (staticmethod)
  - Tries to extract a config URL from the page:
    - First, looks for an object tag with data pointing to videomore.ru/player.swf with a config=URL to an XML.
    - If not found, looks for an iframe pointing to videomore.ru/embed/...
  - If found, returns the extracted URL. Used to detect embedded video URLs in pages.
- _real_extract(self, url)
  - Parses display_id from URL via _match_id.
  - Retrieves partner_id (from URL query or default '97').
  - Downloads config data from https://siren.more.tv/player/config with partner_id and track_id.
  - Extracts the first item from data.playlist.items.
  - Metadata: title, series (project_name), season_name, episode_name. If no title, builds a title from available series/season/episode values.
  - Streams: collects any existing streams and also appends protocol-specific URLs if present (DASH/HLS).
  - Formats: For each stream URL:
    - If protocol == 'DASH': _extract_mpd_formats(...)
    - If protocol == 'HLS': _extract_m3u8_formats(...)
    - If protocol == 'MSS': _extract_ism_formats(...)
  - Error handling:
    - If no formats found, checks item['error']:
      - If the error indicates geo-restriction (RU-only messages), raises a geo restriction for RU.
      - Otherwise raises ExtractorError with the error message.
  - Returns a dict with:
    - id, title, series, season, episode, thumbnail, duration, view_count, age_limit
    - formats (sorted via _sort_formats)
  - Notes:
    - Duration and numeric fields are parsed via int_or_none.
    - Uses compat helpers for URL/query handling to be Python-2/3 compatible.

3) VideomoreVideoIE (VideomoreBaseIE)
- IE_NAME = 'videomore:video'
- _VALID_URL: Based on VideomoreBaseIE._VALID_URL_BASE with an id group that matches a variety of path patterns (two-level path or fragment).
- _TESTS: Several tests for:
  - Single video (with og:video:iframe)
  - Seasoned series (1 season/14 episode)
  - Other pages that should be matched or skipped
- Inheritance: Subclass of VideomoreBaseIE
- Suitable override:
  - suitable() returns False if VideomoreIE.suitable(url) is True, otherwise uses the parent suitable logic. This separates single-video pages from other types handled by VideomoreIE.
- _real_extract(self, url)
  - display_id = self._match_id(url)
  - Returns result by calling self._download_page_data(display_id) and then wrapping it with self._track_url_result(...)
  - Effectively redirects to VideomoreIE for actual video extraction by resolving the page’s track data.

4) VideomoreSeasonIE (VideomoreBaseIE)
- IE_NAME = 'videomore:season'
- _VALID_URL: Base URL plus a season identifier in a two-part path (e.g., molodezhka/film_o_filme).
- _TESTS: Includes tests for:
  - A season page with a known title/id and playlist_mincount
  - Other season-like URLs that should be matched or skipped
- Suitable override:
  - suitable() returns True only if neither VideomoreIE nor VideomoreVideoIE deem the URL suitable; otherwise False. This ensures season-level pages are handled distinctively.
- _real_extract(self, url)
  - display_id = self._match_id(url)
  - season = self._download_page_data(display_id)
  - season_id = compat_str(season['id'])
  - Fetches tracks via API: _API_BASE_URL + 'seasons/%s/tracks' % season_id
  - For each track in tracks, builds a Video URL result via self._track_url_result(track)
  - Returns a playlist_result of those entries with the season title as playlist title.

Important Implementation Details
- API Interactions
  - Page data endpoint: /api/v3/web/PageData with url parameter.
  - Season tracks endpoint: /api/v3/web/seasons/{season_id}/tracks
  - Player config endpoint: https://siren.more.tv/player/config with partner_id and track_id.
- URL Handling
  - Uses compat_parse_qs and compat_urllib_parse_urlparse for robust query handling across Py2/3.
  - _VALID_URL patterns are broad to accommodate embedded players, direct videomore URLs, and odysseus/more.tv players.
- Track Resolution
  - _track_url_result(track) prioritizes trackVod.playerLink, falling back to trackVod['link'], and passes hubId to the downstream VideomoreIE.
- Formats Extraction
  - Supports multiple streaming formats:
    - DASH (mpd)
    - HLS (m3u8)
    - MSS/ISM (for MMS-style streams)
  - Uses built-in extractors: _extract_mpd_formats, _extract_m3u8_formats, _extract_ism_formats.
  - Formats are collected from both explicit stream entries and protocol URLs provided in item['streams'].
- Metadata Handling
  - Title: taken from item.title; if missing, concatenates series, season, and episode to form a reasonable title.
  - Other fields: series, season, episode, thumbnail, duration, view_count, age_limit (with int_or_none for safe numeric parsing).
- Error and Geo Handling
  - If no formats found, checks item.get('error') and converts certain Russian geo-restriction messages into a geo-restriction error for RU.
  - Otherwise raises ExtractorError with the provided message.
- Geo Bypass
  - _GEO_BYPASS is set to False by default (can be toggled in subclass if needed).
- Tests
  - The _TESTS arrays provide representative URLs for each extractor class to validate behavior, including skip_download hints, expected IDs, and titles.
- Edge Cases
  - Handles both single videos and season/playlist pages.
  - Some URLs may redirect or require login (as reflected in tests with “Requires logging in” skip).

Summary of Main Functionality
- VideomoreBaseIE provides core helpers for API data retrieval and track-based URL resolution.
- VideomoreIE handles obtaining video data from More.tv’s player config API, constructing formats, handling geo restrictions, and returning detailed metadata.
- VideomoreVideoIE resolves a page URL to a track and defers to VideomoreIE for extraction.
- VideomoreSeasonIE builds a playlist by aggregating all tracks within a season through API calls.
- The module supports multiple streaming protocols (DASH, HLS, MSS) and robustly handles metadata, errors, and geo-blocking.
