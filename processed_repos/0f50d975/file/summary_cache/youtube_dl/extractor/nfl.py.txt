Concise but comprehensive summary of the code in nfl.py

Overview
- This module implements NFL-related extractors for youtube-dl (yt-dlp style).
- It provides a shared base extractor NFLBaseIE and two concrete extractors:
  - NFLIE for NFL video/listen/audio pages on nfl.com and team sites.
  - NFLArticleIE for NFL article pages under /news that contain multiple video configurations.

Key classes and responsibilities
- NFLBaseIE(InfoExtractor)
  - Central logic to parse a video configuration embedded in the page.
  - Uses a single regex (_VIDEO_CONFIG_REGEX) to locate JSON video config blocks within script tags (id matching video-config-<hash>).
  - _parse_video_config(video_config, display_id):
    - Parses the JSON, grabs the first playlist item.
    - If item has mcpID, returns a reference to an Anvato asset (Anvato video service) via self.url_result(..., 'Anvato', mcp_id).
    - Otherwise:
      - Determines media_id from item['id'] or item['entityId'], and title, URL, etc.
      - If the URL extension is m3u8, fetches formats via _extract_m3u8_formats and sorts them.
      - If not m3u8, uses the direct URL; if item['audio'] is True, marks video codec as none (audio-only).
      - Detects live content via video_config['live'] and adjusts title using _live_title when live.
      - Builds thumbnails from imageSrc/posterImage if available, inferring extension with determine_ext.
      - Returns a dict with id, URL/formats, title, is_live, description, thumbnails, and possibly vcodec.
- NFLIE(NFLBaseIE)
  - Extractor for standard NFL video/listen/audio pages.
  - _VALID_URL: based on a large _VALID_URL_BASE plus path (videos|video|listen|audio)/id
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Downloads the page, searches for a video config with _VIDEO_CONFIG_REGEX, then passes it to _parse_video_config.
- NFLArticleIE(NFLBaseIE)
  - Extractor for NFL article pages containing multiple video configs.
  - _VALID_URL: _VALID_URL_BASE + r'news/(?P<id>[^/#?&]+)'
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Downloads the article page, finds all video-config script blocks with _VIDEO_CONFIG_REGEX, parses each via _parse_video_config, collecting entries.
    - Title resolution: prefers the article title element (nfl-c-article__title); falls back to og:title/twitter:title meta tags.
    - Returns a playlist_result of all parsed entries with the article’s display_id and title.
- Helpers and imports:
  - clean_html, determine_ext, get_element_by_class used for cleaning HTML, inferring extensions, and extracting elements.
  - _parse_json, _live_title, _extract_m3u8_formats provided by the base InfoExtractor class.
  - _html_search_meta used to read title from meta tags as fallback.

Important implementation details
- Video config discovery:
  - _VIDEO_CONFIG_REGEX matches a script tag with id video-config-<hash> and captures the JSON object inside.
  - The same regex is used by both NFLIE and NFLArticleIE, enabling single-source parsing of video data.
- Anvato path:
  - If the item contains mcpID, the code routes to an Anvato asset via a constructed URL and uses the Anvato extractor name.
- Direct video path:
  - If the config item URL ends with m3u8, the extractor pulls multiple formats via _extract_m3u8_formats (with bitrate-optimized mp4 handling) and sorts formats.
  - If not m3u8, use the direct URL; if the item specifies audio: True, set vcodec to 'none' (audio-only stream).
- Live content and metadata:
  - is_live flag is derived from video_config.get('live') and reflected in the returned info.
  - When live, the title is wrapped with _live_title to show live status.
  - Thumbnails are optionally returned if imageSrc/posterImage exist, with ext inferred via determine_ext.
  - Description is cleaned via clean_html on the item’s description field.
- Article handling:
  - NFLArticleIE aggregates multiple video configurations on an article page into a single playlist, each entry processed by _parse_video_config.
  - The article title is determined from a dedicated article title element or falls back to meta title tags.
- URL patterns and tests:
  - NFLBaseIE._VALID_URL_BASE covers a wide set of NFL domain subsites (nfl.com and multiple team domains, plus clubs.nfl.com).
  - NFLIE targets /videos, /video, /listen, /audio paths; NFLArticleIE targets /news paths.
  - Included tests demonstrate handling of mp4 and mp3 entries, and also cases that are only matching (to verify regex behavior).

In short
- The code provides a robust mechanism to extract video (and audio) content from NFL-related pages by locating embedded video configuration JSON, supporting direct video URLs and Anvato-backed assets, handling live streams, M3U8 formats, thumbnails, and article-level playlists.
