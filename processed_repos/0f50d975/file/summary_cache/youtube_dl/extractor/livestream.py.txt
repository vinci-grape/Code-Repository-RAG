This code defines YouTube-DL extractors for Livestream, handling both the newer Livestream site and the original variant, plus a tiny redirector for the shortener service.

Overview
- Purpose: Extract video and live-stream metadata and download formats from Livestream (new and original domains) and from the shortener service.
- Outputs: For each video, a dict with id, title, description, thumbnail, duration, timestamp, view/like counts, and a list of downloadable formats. For playlists/events, a playlist result with entries pointing to individual videos.

Key classes
1) LivestreamIE (modern Livestream extractor)
   - IE_NAME: 'livestream'
   - _VALID_URL: Handles URLs like:
     - https://livestream.com/accounts/<id>/events/<event_id>/videos/<video_id>
     - or without video_id (event page)
     - also supports new/old account/event path variants
   - Core workflow:
     - _real_extract determines if URL points to a single video or an event.
     - For a video: fetch video data from API and call _extract_video_info.
     - For an event: fetch event data, possibly via a feed.json loop, and build a playlist of video URLs (each to a specific video page).
   - Main helpers:
     - _parse_smil_formats(smil, smil_url, video_id, namespace=None, ...): Parses SMIL to extract FLV formats from <video> elements. Builds base URL from httpBase meta or a default Akamai base. Returns a list of formats like smil_<bitrate>.
     - _extract_video_info(video_data): Builds formats from:
       - sd/hd progressive URLs (if available)
       - smil_url (via _extract_smil_formats)
       - m3u8_url (HLS, via _extract_m3u8_formats)
       - f4m_url (HD, via _extract_f4m_formats)
       Sorts formats and returns metadata including id, title (caption), description, thumbnail, duration (ms to seconds), timestamp, like_count, view_count, and a list of comments (parsed with parse_iso8601).
     - _extract_stream_info(stream_info): Handles live streams (play_url SMIL, m3u8_url for HLS, rtsp_url). Returns formats, id, title, thumbnail, and is_live flag.
     - _extract_event(event_data): When an event doesnâ€™t provide stream_info directly, fetches feed.json pages to enumerate videos and builds a playlist of video URLs. Returns a playlist_result.
   - Data details:
     - Formats can be FLV (SMIL), HLS (m3u8_native), RTSP, or progressive URLs.
     - Duration often converted from milliseconds to seconds; timestamps parsed with parse_iso8601.
     - Comments extracted from video_data['comments']['data'].
   - API usage:
     - Uses a template API URL: http://livestream.com/api/accounts/%s/events/%s
     - For event pages with streaming, may fetch feed.json to populate playlist entries.

2) LivestreamOriginalIE (legacy Livestream)
   - IE_NAME: 'livestream:original'
   - _VALID_URL: Matches original.livestream.com URLs (folder or video pages).
   - Core workflow:
     - _real_extract handles folders (via _extract_folder) or individual videos.
     - For a video: fetch XML from 2.0/clipdetails API and extract basic fields (title, duration, thumbnail, view_count) via XML parsing.
     - For formats: _extract_video_formats reads progressiveUrl (HTTP), httpUrl (HLS m3u8), and rtspUrl (RTSP) and returns a sorted formats list.
     - _extract_folder scrapes the folder page to collect sub-entries (folders or videos) and returns a playlist_result.
   - Notes:
     - XML parsing uses namespaces (media, ls, etc.) to extract fields.
     - Title and metadata come from the XML item element; duration converted to float if present.

3) LivestreamShortenerIE (shortener redirector)
   - IE_NAME: 'livestream:shortener'
   - IE_DESC: False (do not list in index)
   - _VALID_URL: livestre.am/<id>
   - _real_extract: Downloads the page and redirects to the Open Graph URL found on the page (self._og_search_url).

Important implementation details
- Formats handling:
  - The modern Livestream extractor aggregates formats from:
    - SD/HD progressive URLs (direct MP4-like URLs)
    - SMIL-based streams (via _parse_smil_formats)
    - HLS (m3u8), with _extract_m3u8_formats
    - F4M (HD/HDX) via _extract_f4m_formats
    - RTSP URLs as a separate format (format_id 'rtsp')
  - SMIL URL parsing uses a base URL from the SMIL meta tag httpBase or a default Livestream base. It constructs FLV URLs with specific query params (v=3.0.3, fp=WIN% 14,0,0,145) and supports clipBegin as ssek for seeking.
  - The code uses determine_ext and bitrate extraction to populate tbr where possible.
  - Formats are sorted with _sort_formats.
- Data extraction:
  - Timestamps are parsed with parse_iso8601.
  - Durations are converted to seconds via float_or_none with a divisor of 1000 when the source is in milliseconds.
  - Comments are built as a list with author_id, author, id, text, and a parsed timestamp.
- Event vs video flow:
  - If a video_id is present in the URL, the extractor fetches the specific video data via /videos/{video_id} and returns a single video info dict.
  - If no video_id, the extractor fetches event data via /accounts/{account}/events/{event} and returns a playlist of videos by enumerating feed.json pages when necessary.
- Live vs VOD:
  - _extract_stream_info handles live streams by marking is_live and using the live title if applicable.
  - The title for live streams is built with _live_title(stream_info['stream_title']).
- Original vs modern API:
  - LivestreamIE uses the newer API structure and SMIL/HLS/F4M with various URLs (play_url, m3u8_url, etc.).
  - LivestreamOriginalIE uses the older 2.0/clipdetails XML API for video data and a separate 3.0 endpoint for live streams.

Test coverage hints
- The _TESTS for LivestreamIE include:
  - A direct video URL with expected id, ext, title, timestamp, duration, like/view counts, and a thumbnail pattern.
  - Event URLs that should resolve to playlists with a minimum number of items.
  - A few edge-case URLs to ensure domain variants and path variants are matched.
- The LivestreamOriginalIE tests cover a sample video, a folder with multiple items, and a live URL in original.livestream.com.
- The ShortenerIE is kept minimal with a small redirect test pattern.

In short, this file provides a comprehensive set of extractors to fetch and normalize metadata and download formats for Livestream videos, both on the modern and original sites, plus a small service to redirect via the shortener domain. It includes robust handling of SMIL, HLS, RTSP, and F4M formats, as well as playlist/event extraction and live-stream metadata.
