Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/techtalks.py

Overview
- Implements TechTalksIE, an extractor for techtalks.tv talks.
- Handles both a single video page and a page that includes a separate slides video, returning either a single video or a playlist with two entries.

Key components
- Class: TechTalksIE (inherits from InfoExtractor)
- URL pattern: _VALID_URL = r'https?://techtalks\.tv/talks/(?:[^/]+/)?(?P<id>\d+)'
  - Captures talk ID as group 'id'
- Helpers from utils:
  - get_element_by_attribute: to locate the title element by class
  - clean_html: to sanitize extracted HTML/text

Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
- Parse talk_id from URL using the _VALID_URL regex.
- Download the talk page HTML (webpage).
- Extract RTMP URL:
  - rtmp_url = _search_regex(r'netConnectionUrl: \'(.*?)\'', webpage, 'rtmp url')
- Extract presenter playback path:
  - play_path = _search_regex(r'href=\'(.*?)\' [^>]*id="flowplayer_presenter"', webpage, 'presenter play path')
- Extract title:
  - title = clean_html(get_element_by_attribute('class', 'title', webpage))
- Build a primary video info dict:
  - id: talk_id
  - title: title
  - url: rtmp_url
  - play_path: play_path
  - ext: 'flv'
- Detect slides video:
  - Look for a slides link with regex: <a class="slides" href='(.*?)'
  - If not found, return the single video_info
  - If found, return a playlist:
    - _type: 'playlist'
    - id: talk_id
    - title: title
    - entries: [
        1) the original video_info,
        2) slides video entry:
           - id: talk_id + '-slides'
           - title: title
           - url: rtmp_url
           - play_path: slides URL (captured group)
           - ext: 'flv'
      ]

Tests (_TESTS)
- Test 1 (with slides present):
  - URL: http://techtalks.tv/talks/learning-topic-models-going-beyond-svd/57758/
  - Expects a playlist with two entries:
    - Entry 1: id '57758', ext 'flv', title as given
    - Entry 2: id '57758-slides', ext 'flv', title same
  - Includes info_dict for the overall talk and skip_download: True (RTMP download skipped in tests)
- Test 2 (only URL, matching):
  - URL: http://techtalks.tv/talks/57758
  - only_matching: True (ensures URL pattern matches)

Implementation details
- Uses named capture group 'id' for robust ID extraction.
- Title extraction uses HTML helper to pull from an element with class="title" and cleans it.
- Slides detection relies on a specific anchor class "slides" to decide between single video and playlist.
- When slides exist, the slides video uses the same RTMP URL but a different play_path (the slides URL), with the same extension.
- Returns either a single video_info dict or a playlist dict with two entries, both using ext 'flv'.
