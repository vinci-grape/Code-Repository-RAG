- Purpose: A YouTube-dl extractor for Walla (Israeli video service). It retrieves video metadata, available RTMP FLV formats, and subtitles from Walla’s XML feed.

- Main class and inheritance:
  - WallaIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL pattern:
  - _VALID_URL = r'https?://vod\.walla\.co\.il/[^/]+/(?P<id>\d+)/(?P<display_id>.+)'
  - Extracts video_id (digits) and display_id (slug) from URLs like http://vod.walla.co.il/movie/2642630/one-direction-all-for-one

- Test data:
  - _TEST contains a sample URL, expected info_dict (id, display_id, ext, title, description as md5, thumbnail, duration), and skip_download for RTMP download.

- Subtitles language mapping:
  - _SUBTITLE_LANGS = {'עברית': 'heb'} to map Hebrew to standard 'heb' code

- Data retrieval workflow (_real_extract):
  - Fetches XML metadata from http://video2.walla.co.il/?w=null/null/%s/@@/video/flv_pl with video_id
  - Parses the first item element: ./items/item

- Metadata extraction:
  - title: from ./title
  - description: from ./synopsis
  - thumbnail: from ./preview_pic
  - duration: integer converted from ./duration (via int_or_none)

- Subtitles extraction:
  - Iterates item.findall('./subtitles/subtitle')
  - Language: from ./title; mapped using _SUBTITLE_LANGS (fallback to original if not mapped)
  - Each subtitle: build entry with ext 'srt' and url from ./src
  - Result: subtitles dict keyed by language code with list of {ext, url}

- Formats extraction:
  - Iterates item.findall('./qualities/quality')
  - For each quality:
    - format_id: from ./title
    - Build format dict:
      - url: 'rtmp://wafla.walla.co.il/vod'
      - play_path: value from ./src
      - player_url: SWF player URL for Walla media
      - page_url: original page URL
      - ext: 'flv'
      - format_id: quality title
    - height extraction: if format_id starts with a numeric height followed by P/p (e.g., "720P"), set fmt['height'] accordingly
  - After collecting, _sort_formats(formats)

- Return structure:
  - id, display_id, title, description, thumbnail, duration, formats, subtitles

- Notable implementation details:
  - Uses _download_xml to fetch Walla’s XML feed and xpath_text/int_or_none helpers to extract values robustly.
  - RTMP-based formats with flv extension and explicit play_path pointing to the RTMP media path.
  - Height parsing from format title to populate standardized format height when available.
  - Includes a SWF-based video player URL in the format metadata.
