Here's a concise, comprehensive summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/spreaker.py.

Purpose
- Implements YouTube-DL extractors for Spreaker:
  - Individual episodes (API v2 and legacy endpoints)
  - Show playlists (listing all episodes)
  - Pages that host episodes or shows (redirecting to the API endpoints)

Main functionality
- _extract_episode(data, episode_id=None)
  - Central helper that converts a Spreaker episode JSON object into a standardized info dictionary used by YouTube-DL.
  - Extracts:
    - id, url, display_id (permalink), title, description
    - timestamp (unified_timestamp on published_at)
    - uploader/uploader_id/creator (robustly via try_get from either show/author fields)
    - duration (tries duration or length, converts ms to seconds)
    - view_count, like_count, comment_count (supports multiple possible field layouts)
    - format details: format 'MPEG Layer 3', mp3 a.k.a. mp3 container/ext
    - thumbnails from image_original, image_medium, image
    - series (show title if present)
    - extractor_key set to SpreakerIE.ie_key()
  - Uses helper utilities: compat_str, int_or_none, float_or_none, str_or_none, try_get, url_or_none, unified_timestamp

Extractor classes
- SpreakerIE (single episode, API v2)
  - _VALID_URL matches:
    - https://api.spreaker.com/episode/<id> (legacy)
    - https://api.spreaker.com/v2/episodes/<id>?export=episode_segments (v2)
  - _TESTS includes sample IDs and expected fields (id, display_id, ext, title, timestamp, uploader, duration, counts, series)
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts episode_id from URL
    - Downloads JSON from https://api.spreaker.com/v2/episodes/<id>
    - Uses data['response']['episode'] as the episode object
    - Returns _extract_episode(data, episode_id)

- SpreakerPageIE (episode page → API)
  - _VALID_URL matches Spreaker user episode pages:
    - https://www.spreaker.com/user/<user>/... (episode)
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Gets display_id from URL
    - Downloads the page HTML
    - Finds episode_id via two regex options:
      - data-episode_id="..."/
      - episode_id: <number>
    - Redirects to SpreakerIE by returning a URL result to https://api.spreaker.com/episode/<episode_id>

- SpreakerShowIE (show/list of episodes)
  - _VALID_URL matches API show endpoints:
    - https://api.spreaker.com/show/<id>
  - _TESTS includes a show with playlist_mincount
  - _entries(show_id)
    - Iterates pages starting at 1
    - Downloads JSON from https://api.spreaker.com/show/<show_id>/episodes with query params page and max_per_page=100
    - Expects pager structure at response.pager; breaks if missing
    - Iterates results (episode dicts), yields _extract_episode(result)
    - Stops when reaching last_page
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts show_id
    - Returns playlist_result of _entries(show_id)

- SpreakerShowPageIE (show page → API)
  - _VALID_URL matches Spreaker show pages:
    - https://www.spreaker.com/show/<show-slug>
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts display_id and downloads the page
    - Finds show_id via regex show_id: <id>
    - Redirects to https://api.spreaker.com/show/<show_id> with SpreakerShowIE as extractor

Key implementation details
- Robust field access:
  - Uses try_get to handle multiple possible JSON shapes for uploader, series, and counts.
  - Thumbnails are gathered from image_original, image_medium, image with url_or_none.
- Consistent episode info
  - The info dict includes id, url, display_id, title, description, timestamp, uploader/creator, duration, counts, thumbnails, and series.
  - Explicit extractor_key points to SpreakerIE.ie_key() to identify extractor provenance.
  - Formats are hard-coded to MP3 (mp3 container/extension).
- Pagination and playback data
  - Show listing uses pager information to determine end-of-list and last page.
  - Uses max_per_page=100 for efficiency.
- Testing
  - Includes _TESTS for each extractor to validate URL matching, fields, and behavior.
- Utilities used
  - compat_str for id strings
  - float_or_none, int_or_none, str_or_none for robust number/string extraction
  - url_or_none to validate thumbnail URLs
  - unified_timestamp to convert published_at to epoch
  - url_result and playlist_result to integrate with YouTube-DL’s result handling

Overall
- The file provides a cohesive set of extractors for Spreaker: direct episode fetch (both legacy and v2), episode pages that redirect to API endpoints, show-based playlists, and show pages that redirect to show API endpoints. It emphasizes robust JSON handling, multiple possible data layouts, and consistent output suitable for YouTube-DL’s standard info dict schema.
