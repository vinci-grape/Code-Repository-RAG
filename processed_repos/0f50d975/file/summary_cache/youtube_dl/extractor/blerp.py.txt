- Purpose: A YouTube-DL extractor for Blerp sound bites. It fetches bite metadata and the MP3 URL using Blerp's GraphQL API and returns a standard InfoExtractor dictionary.

- Key class:
  - BlerpIE(InfoExtractor)
    - IE_NAME: 'blerp'
    - _VALID_URL: Validates URLs like https://blerp.com/soundbites/{id}
    - _TESTS: Two test cases verifying id, title, uploader, uploader_id, ext (mp3), and tags

- Main functionality (core method):
  - _real_extract(self, url)
    - Extracts the bite id from the URL via _match_id.
    - Builds a GraphQL request payload containing:
      - operationName: "webBitePageGetBite"
      - query: a long GraphQL query (_GRAPHQL_QUERY) with a fragment bitePageFrag that fetches many bite fields
      - variables: { "_id": audio_id }
    - Sends a POST request to https://api.blerp.com/graphql with:
      - JSON body (data serialized as JSON and encoded to UTF-8)
      - Header: Content-Type: application/json
    - Parses the JSON response and navigates to data.web.biteById
    - Constructs and returns an info_dict with:
      - id: bite_json['_id']
      - url: bite_json['audio']['mp3']['url']
      - title: bite_json['title']
      - uploader: ownerObject.username (safely extracted with traverse_obj and strip_or_none)
      - uploader_id: ownerObject._id (safely extracted)
      - ext: 'mp3'
      - tags: a cleaned list derived from userKeywords, stripping nulls/text, or None if empty

- Important implementation details:
  - Uses utils.traverse_obj and utils.strip_or_none to safely extract nested fields (including uploader and uploader_id) without raising if some fields are missing.
  - Tags extraction pulls from userKeywords, coerces to a list when present, strips each value, filters out empties, and returns None if there are no tags.
  - The GraphQL query is defined as a constant (_GRAPHQL_QUERY) and executed with a simple variables payload, enabling precise retrieval of light-weight bite data.
  - The MP3 URL is taken from bite_json['audio']['mp3']['url'], ensuring direct media access.
  - Tests expect specific fields (id, title, uploader, uploader_id, ext mp3, tags) to confirm correct extraction.

- What it does not do:
  - Does not extract or expose all possible fields from the GraphQL response; focuses on id, media URL, title, uploader info, and tags.
  - Does not handle non-MP3 audio formats (ext is fixed to 'mp3' in info_dict).

In short, this extractor queries Blerpâ€™s GraphQL API for a bite by ID, parses the response to obtain the MP3 URL and metadata, cleans and returns a concise info_dict suitable for youtube-dl's downstream processing.
