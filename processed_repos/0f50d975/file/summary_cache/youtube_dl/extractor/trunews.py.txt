- Purpose: TruNewsIE is a YouTube-DL extractor that maps a TruNews streaming URL to a Zype video and delegates extraction to the Zype extractor.

- Class and inheritance:
  - TruNewsIE extends InfoExtractor.

- Key attributes:
  - _VALID_URL: Regex to match TruNews stream pages and capture the video id as display_id.
  - _TEST: Example test case showing the expected output (id, display_id, ext, title, description, duration, timestamp, upload_date) and that this uses the Zype extractor.
  - _ZYPE_TEMPL: Template URL for embedding the corresponding Zype player: https://player.zype.com/embed/%s.js?api_key=...

- Main functionality (_real_extract):
  - Extract display_id from the URL using _match_id.
  - Fetch Zype video data via API call to https://api.zype.com/videos with query parameters:
    - app_key: API key (PUVKp9WgGUb3-JUw6EqafLx8tFVP6VKZTWbUOR-HOm__g4fNDt1bCsm_LgYf_k9H)
    - per_page: 1
    - active: 'true'
    - friendly_title: display_id
  - Parse the response to obtain zype_id from response[0]['_id'].
  - Return a final URL result pointing to the Zype embed using _ZYPE_TEMPL % zype_id, with the existing Zype extractor as the designated extractor and zype_id as the video id.

- Implementation details:
  - The extractor does not pull the video directly; it delegates to the Zype extractor after resolving the corresponding Zype video ID.
  - Uses _download_json to perform the API request and handles JSON structure expecting response[0]['_id'].
  - The _TEST indicates the final media is an mp4 with metadata provided by Zype (via the Zype extractor).

- Notes:
  - Contains hard-coded API keys for Zype, implying reliance on external services and potential maintenance if keys change.
  - The add_ie = ['Zype'] mechanism ensures the final metadata (title, description, duration, etc.) is sourced from the Zype metadata.
