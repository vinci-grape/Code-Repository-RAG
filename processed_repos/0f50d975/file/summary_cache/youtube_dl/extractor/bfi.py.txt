Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/bfi.py

- Purpose
  - Implements an extractor for BFI (British Film Institute) player pages. It finds embedded Ooyala videos on a BFI page and exposes them as a playlist of Ooyala entries.

- Main class
  - BFIPlayerIE(InfoExtractor)
    - IE_NAME = 'bfi:player'
    - _VALID_URL: Regex that matches BFI player watch pages, e.g. https://player.bfi.org.uk/.../film/watch-<slug>-online
    - _TEST: Sample URL with expected metadata and a skip note indicating playback may be blocked outside the UK

- Key methods and workflow
  - _real_extract(self, url)
    - video_id = self._match_id(url): extracts the Ooyala video ID or page-specific ID from the URL using the _VALID_URL regex.
    - webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id): downloads the HTML content of the BFI page.
    - Scans the page for embedded players using the regex (?s)<[^>]+class="player"[^>]*> to locate HTML elements with class="player".
    - For each matching player element:
      - player_attr = extract_attributes(player_el): parses HTML tag attributes into a dictionary.
      - ooyala_id = player_attr.get('data-video-id'): obtains the Ooyala video ID.
      - If no data-video-id is present, skip this element.
      - entries.append(self.url_result('ooyala:' + ooyala_id, 'Ooyala', ooyala_id, player_attr.get('data-label'))):
        - Creates a URL result pointing to the Ooyala extractor with:
          - URL: ooyala:<id>
          - IE: 'Ooyala'
          - video_id: the Ooyala ID
          - display_id/label: the data-label attribute (used for naming)
    - Returns self.playlist_result(entries): aggregates all discovered Ooyala videos into a single playlist result.

- Important implementation details
  - Multi-video handling: The code supports multiple embedded Ooyala players on a single BFI page and returns a playlist of all found videos.
  - Tag attribute parsing: Uses extract_attributes to read data attributes from the HTML tag (notably data-video-id and data-label).
  - External extractor integration: Delegates actual video extraction to the Ooyala extractor by using the constructed ooyala: URL, enabling reuse of existing Ooyala logic.
  - Fallback behavior: If a player element lacks a data-video-id, it is ignored rather than causing failure.
  - UK geo-block note: The _TEST includes a skip message indicating that BFI Player films cannot be played outside of the UK, reflecting typical geographic restrictions of the source site.

In short, BFIPlayerIE parses a BFI player page for elements with class="player", extracts Ooyala video IDs, and returns a playlist of Ooyala video entries with optional human-friendly labels.
