Summary of the Podomatic extractor (youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/podomatic.py):

- Purpose
  - Implements an InfoExtractor for Podomatic to extract episode/audio information and direct MP3 URLs and return a standardized info dict for youtube-dl.

- Key class
  - PodomaticIE (inherits from InfoExtractor)
    - IE_NAME = 'podomatic'
    - _VALID_URL: Regular expression (verbose) that matches two Podomatic URL forms:
      - https://<channel>.podomatic.com/entry/<id>
      - https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/<channel>/episodes/<id>
      - Captures: proto (http/https), channel (or channel_2), and id
    - _TESTS: Includes sample URLs with expected metadata:
      - Two actual MP3 entries with id, uploader, uploader_id, title, duration, and md5
      - A third URL in the pods/episodes form marked as only_matching to test URL pattern recognition

- Core functionality (_real_extract)
  - Parse URL with _VALID_URL to obtain:
    - video_id = the captured id
    - channel = either channel or channel_2 from the URL
  - Build a JSON data URL for embedded parameters:
    - {proto}://{channel}.podomatic.com/entry/embed_params/{video_id}?permalink=true&rtmp=0
  - Download and parse JSON:
    - data = json.loads(self._download_webpage(json_url, video_id, 'Downloading video info'))
  - Resolve media URL (video_url):
    - Prefer data['downloadLink'] if present and non-empty
    - If not, construct video_url from data:
      - data['streamer'] with 'rtmp' replaced by 'http'
      - combine with data['mediaLocation']
  - Extract metadata:
    - uploader = data['podcast']
    - title = data['title']
    - thumbnail = data['imageLocation']
    - duration: int_or_none(data.get('length'), 1000) (likely converts milliseconds to seconds)
  - Return a dict with:
    - id: video_id
    - url: video_url
    - title
    - uploader
    - uploader_id: channel
    - thumbnail
    - duration

- Important implementation details
  - Uses a robust URL regex to support both entry and podcast episode forms.
  - Uses an embedded params JSON endpoint to fetch metadata and media URLs.
  - Handles missing downloadLink by constructing a workaround URL from streamer and mediaLocation.
  - Converts length (likely in milliseconds) to seconds via int_or_none(length, 1000).
  - Returns only standard fields commonly used by youtube-dl (id, url, title, uploader, uploader_id, thumbnail, duration).

Overall, the extractor focuses on retrieving Podomatic episode/audio data via an embedded JSON endpoint and producing a typical info dict for downstream processing.
