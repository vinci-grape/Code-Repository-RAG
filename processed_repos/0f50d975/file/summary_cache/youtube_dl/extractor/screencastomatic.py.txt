Concise summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/screencastomatic.py

- Purpose
  - Implement an InfoExtractor for Screencast-O-Matic to extract video metadata and the direct video URL from screencast-o-matic pages.

- Key class
  - ScreencastOMaticIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL matching
  - _VALID_URL matches several Screencast-O-Matic URL forms to extract a video ID:
    - /watch/<id>
    - /player/<id>
    - /embed?...&sc=<id>
  - The captured id is named group 'id'.

- Testing
  - _TESTS includes:
    - A typical watch URL with expected metadata (md5, title, ext, thumbnail, description, duration, upload_date).
    - Additional tests with only_matching for other URL forms (player and embed).

- Core extraction logic (_real_extract)
  - Extracts video_id via _match_id(url).
  - Downloads the player page using _download_webpage with URL https://screencast-o-matic.com/player/<video_id>.
  - Parses the HTML5 media entries with _parse_html5_media_entries(url, webpage, video_id)[0] to obtain the base info dict (including the direct media URL and 'ext', etc.).
  - Enriches the info dict with:
    - id: video_id
    - title: content of element with class 'overlayTitle' (via get_element_by_class)
    - description: content of element with class 'overlayDescription' (via get_element_by_class) stripped with strip_or_none; if empty, set to None
    - duration: integer parsed from JavaScript code snippet matching player.duration function return value via a regex; converted with int_or_none
    - upload_date: date parsed from element with class 'overlayPublished', stripping the prefix 'Published: ' with remove_start and converting to YYYYMMDD via unified_strdate
  - Returns the enriched info dict.

- Important implementation details
  - Uses _parse_html5_media_entries to obtain the actual media entries (e.g., MP4 URLs) and the fundamental metadata like extension.
  - Title, description, and published date are extracted from overlay-prefixed HTML elements on the page.
  - Duration is extracted by locating a specific JavaScript function snippet in the page that returns the duration (regex look-up).
  - upload_date is normalized to a standard format using unified_strdate.
  - The code prefers robust null handling: description becomes None if absent; duration may be None if not found.

- External helpers used
  - get_element_by_class: to fetch title/description/published date from HTML elements by class.
  - int_or_none: to safely convert duration to int.
  - remove_start: to strip a known prefix from strings before date parsing.
  - strip_or_none: to clean description safely, with None fallback.
  - unified_strdate: to convert date strings to the standard YYYYMMDD format.
  - _download_webpage, _match_id, _parse_html5_media_entries: inherited/auxiliary methods from InfoExtractor to fetch pages, extract IDs, and parse media entries.

Overall, this extractor handles multiple Screencast-O-Matic URL formats, retrieves the page, derives the video URL and metadata, and outputs a complete info dictionary suitable for downloading and listing.
