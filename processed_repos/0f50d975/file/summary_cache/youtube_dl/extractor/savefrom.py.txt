Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/savefrom.py

Purpose:
- Implement a youtube-dl extractor for savefrom.net that extracts the real video URL embedded in SaveFrom’s page and delegates extraction to the appropriate corresponding extractor (e.g., YouTube).

Key components:
- Class: SaveFromIE(InfoExtractor)
  - IE_NAME = 'savefrom.net'
  - _VALID_URL: Regex that matches URLs of the form http(s)://<subdomain>.savefrom.net/#url=<target_url> and captures the inner URL as group 'url'.
  - _TEST: Includes a sample SaveFrom URL and the expected result (video id, extension, title, uploader, upload_date, description) and a hint to skip actual download.

Main functionality:
- _real_extract(self, url)
  - Uses re.match with _VALID_URL to obtain the captured inner URL (the actual video URL) from the SaveFrom URL.
  - Derives a video_id by taking the last path segment of the provided URL and stripping the extension (though in practice, given the SaveFrom URL structure this yields a value like '#url=http:...' which is unused for actual download, and the real id is effectively taken from the inner URL later).
  - Returns self.url_result(mobj.group('url'), video_id=video_id), which delegates the extraction to the appropriate extractor for the inner URL (e.g., YouTube).

Implementation details:
- Dependency on InfoExtractor base class from youtube-dl.
- Uses Python standard libraries: re for regex matching, os.path for simple path processing to derive video_id.
- The inner URL captured by the _VALID_URL regex (group 'url') is the URL that youtube-dl will process next.
- The _TEST’s info_dict expects properties typical of a YouTube video (id, ext, title, upload_date, uploader, uploader_id, description) demonstrating that the inner URL resolves to a standard video resource.
- Param 'skip_download': True is specified in _TEST to avoid downloading during tests.

Overall:
- This extractor acts as a bridge: it recognizes SaveFrom URLs that embed the actual video URL, extracts that inner URL, and forwards extraction to the appropriate dedicated extractor for that video platform.
