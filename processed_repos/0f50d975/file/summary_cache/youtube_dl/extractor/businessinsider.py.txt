- Purpose: A youtube-dl extractor for Business Insider video pages that delegates actual video extraction to JW Platform (JWPlatformIE).

- Core class: BusinessInsiderIE inherits from InfoExtractor.

- URL matching (_VALID_URL):
  - Matches Business Insider pages on businessinsider.* (com or nl) with any subpath and captures the last path segment as video id.
  - Example: http://uk.businessinsider.com/... or https://www.businessinsider.nl/...

- How it extracts video data (_real_extract):
  - Extracts video_id from the URL using _match_id.
  - Downloads the page content with _download_webpage.
  - Searches the page for a JW Platform video id using multiple regex patterns (to handle different embed formats):
    - data-media-id="<8 alphanumeric chars>"
    - id="jwplayer_<8 alphanumeric chars>"
    - id: "<8 alphanumeric chars>" (in JS-like object)
    - (?:jwplatform\.com/players/|jwplayer_)<8 alphanumeric chars>
  - The JW Platform id is expected to be an 8-character alphanumeric string.

- Output:
  - Returns a URL result pointing to the JW Platform extractor: 'jwplatform:<jwplatform_id>'.
  - Uses JWPlatformIE.ie_key() as the extractor to delegate actual video extraction.
  - Passes video_id as the captured Business Insider page id, so the final video metadata is tied to that id.

- Key implementation details:
  - Uses a resilient set of regexes to locate the JW Platform id across different embedding patterns.
  - The extracted JW Platform id is 8 alphanumeric characters.
  - The final video info is fetched by JWPlatformIE, not by its own parser.

- Tests (_TESTS):
  - Includes two full-page examples (UK NL variants) with expected video ids, titles, descriptions (via md5), upload dates, and timestamps.
  - A third test demonstrates only_matching for a non-target page.
  - Tests show typical JW Platform IDs like 'cjGDb0X9' and '5zJwd4FK' and expect mp4 format.

In short, this extractor identifies Business Insider video pages, locates the underlying JW Platform video identifier via multiple patterns, and hands off to JWPlatformIE to obtain the actual video metadata and streams.
