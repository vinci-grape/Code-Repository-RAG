concisely describe the main functionality and implementation details of the code in DRBonanza extractor.

What it does
- Implements a YouTube-DL (youtube_dl) extractor for DR.dk Bonanza video pages.
- Combines information from two sources on the page:
  - HTML5 media entries (formats such as MP4 or HLS) via the standard HTML5 media parsing helper.
  - A JavaScript object embedded in the page (currentAsset) that contains metadata like title, description, duration, and thumbnail.
- Merges both sources into a single video information dictionary returned to the caller.

Key components and workflow
- Class DRBonanzaIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Regex to recognize DR Bonanza episode URLs and capture two parts:
    - id: numeric asset id from the URL path
    - display_id: human-friendly slug from the URL
  - _TEST: Provides a sample URL and the expected info_dict for testing, including id, display_id, extension, title, description (as md5), thumbnail pattern, and duration.

- _real_extract(self, url)
  1. Parse URL with _VALID_URL to obtain video_id and display_id.
  2. Download the page HTML via _download_webpage.
  3. Extract initial video formats using:
     - _parse_html5_media_entries(url, webpage, display_id, m3u8_id='hls', m3u8_entry_protocol='m3u8_native')
     - Take the first entry and call it info; then sort its formats with _sort_formats(info['formats']).
     - This yields the primary format list (including HLS) for the video.
  4. Extract asset metadata from JavaScript:
     - Find a JavaScript object assigned to currentAsset with a regex on the page.
     - Parse the matched JSON-like string using _parse_json(..., transform_source=js_to_json) to convert JS to Python dict.
     - The resulting asset dict provides fields like AssetTitle, AssetId, AssetImageUrl.
  5. Title handling:
     - title = unescapeHTML(asset['AssetTitle']).strip()
  6. Inline helper extract(field):
     - Uses a regex to pull textual content from the page HTML corresponding to fields such as Programinfo (description) and Tid (duration).
     - Returns None if not found.
  7. Build final info dictionary by updating the initially extracted info with:
     - 'id': asset.get('AssetId') or video_id
     - 'display_id': display_id
     - 'title': title
     - 'description': extract('Programinfo')
     - 'duration': parse_duration(extract('Tid'))
     - 'thumbnail': asset.get('AssetImageUrl')
  8. Return the merged info dictionary (which already contains the formats from step 3).

Important implementation details
- Uses two data sources on the page:
  - HTML5 media entries (handled by _parse_html5_media_entries with HLS via m3u8_id and m3u8_native protocol).
  - A JavaScript object currentAsset embedded in the page, parsed via _search_regex and _parse_json with js_to_json to convert JS syntax to JSON.
- Title is taken from AssetTitle (HTML-unescaped); duration is parsed from Tid using parse_duration.
- id falls back to the numeric id from the URL if AssetId isnâ€™t present.
- Description is extracted from the HTML segment labeled Programinfo; if not found, it remains None.
- The code is designed for compatibility with both Python 2 and 3 (unicode_literals import).

Overall, the extractor robustly pulls both the media formats and metadata from a DR Bonanza page and compiles them into a standard video info dictionary for downstream processing by youtube-dl.
