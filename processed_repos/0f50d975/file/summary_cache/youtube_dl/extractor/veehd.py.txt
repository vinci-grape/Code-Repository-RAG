Summary of code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/veehd.py

Purpose
- Implement a YouTube-DL extractor (VeeHDIE) for veehd.com video pages to obtain a direct video URL and metadata (title, uploader, thumbnail, description).

Key components
- Class VeeHDIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: RegEx matching veehd video URLs of the form https?://veehd.com/video/<id>
  - _TESTS: Three test cases with sample URLs and expected info_dict entries; one test is skipped because the video was removed. Notes that md5 is omitted in tests due to multiple server copies with different checksums.

Main functionality (_real_extract)
1) Video ID extraction
   - video_id = self._match_id(url)

2) Workaround for VeeHD page garbage
   - Downloads the video page twice:
     - First: self._download_webpage(url, video_id, 'Requesting webpage')
     - Second: self._download_webpage(url, video_id)
   - Rationale: handles reported garbage on the first request (referenced issue).

3) Check for removed video
   - If the page contains "This video has been removed<", raise ExtractorError indicating removal (expected=True).

4) Locate player iframe path and URL
   - Extracts the player path from the page with:
     - r'\$\("#playeriframe"\).attr\({src : "(.+?)"'
   - Builds the full player_url via urljoin with the original URL.

5) Load player page
   - Downloads the player page twice (again, to ensure content loaded):
     - First: self._download_webpage(player_url, video_id, 'Requesting player page')
     - Second: self._download_webpage(player_url, video_id, 'Downloading player page')

6) Resolve the direct video URL
   - Tries several fallbacks in order:
     a) Config JSON
        - Looks for value='config=({.+?})' in the player_page
        - If found, parses JSON and sets video_url = unquoted config['clip']['url']
     b) Direct embed
        - If video_url not found, searches for an embed tag with type="video/divx" and gets its src as video_url
     c) Iframe fall-back
        - If still not found, extracts an iframe src from the player_page
        - Builds iframe_url as 'http://veehd.com/%s' % iframe_src
        - Downloads the iframe page and extracts video_url from a JavaScript-like structure using:
          r"file\s*:\s*'([^']+)'"
        - This sequence handles pages that embed the video inside an iframe or a separate player.

7) Metadata extraction
   - title: from element with id 'videoName', trimmed to anything before the last '|' character, using clean_html
   - uploader_id: extracted via regex <a href="/profile/\d+">(.+?)</a> from the page
   - thumbnail: from img with id "veehdpreview"
   - description: extracted from a block with a pattern in a table cell:
     r'<td class="infodropdown".*?<div>(.*?)<ul', using DOTALL mode

8) Return value
   - A dict with:
     - '_type': 'video'
     - 'id': video_id
     - 'title': title
     - 'url': video_url
     - 'uploader_id': uploader_id
     - 'thumbnail': thumbnail
     - 'description': description

Implementation details and notes
- Uses helper utilities from youtube-dl:
  - _download_webpage for HTTP requests
  - _search_regex and _html_search_regex for extracting data
  - get_element_by_id and clean_html for robust text extraction
  - compat_urlparse.urljoin to construct absolute URLs
  - compat_urllib_parse_unquote to decode encoded URLs
- Robust multi-step extraction to accommodate different veehd page structures:
  - Primary path via the player iframe’s config JSON
  - Fallback to direct embed URL
  - Fallback to iframe-contained video URL
- Error handling:
  - Raises ExtractorError with expected flag when a video is removed
- Testing considerations:
  - MD5 is not asserted in tests due to multiple server copies with different checksums; the code omits md5 in _TESTS as noted in comments.

In short, VeeHDIE navigates veehd.com’s pages and nested players/iframes to extract a direct video URL along with title, uploader, thumbnail, and description, handling several edge cases and page structures along the way.
