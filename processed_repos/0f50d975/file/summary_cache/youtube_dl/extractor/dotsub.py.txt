concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/dotsub.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for dotsub.com video pages (DotsubIE).

- Key class and constants
  - DotsubIE(InfoExtractor): inherits common extractor behavior.
  - _VALID_URL: regex matching URLs like https://dotsub.com/view/<id>.
  - _TESTS: two sample tests with expected info_dict fields (id, ext, title, description, thumbnail, duration, uploader, timestamp, upload_date, view_count, etc.). Second test includes uploader_id and add_ie: ['Vimeo'].

- Core functionality (_real_extract)
  1. Extract video_id from URL using _match_id.
  2. Try to fetch metadata via API:
     - info = self._download_json('https://dotsub.com/api/media/%s/metadata' % video_id, video_id)
     - video_url = info.get('mediaURI')
  3. If API does not provide a direct URL (video_url is missing):
     - Download the page HTML (webpage).
     - Try to locate a direct video URL in the HTML via regex:
       - <source src="..."
       - "file": '...'
     - If found, build info_dict with id, url, and ext: 'flv'.
  4. If video_url is still not found (another fallback):
     - Search for a data-setup attribute in the page, parse its JSON content to obtain a src.
     - Build info_dict as a URL-transparent entry: {'_type': 'url_transparent', 'url': setup_data['src']}.
  5. Enrich the info_dict with common metadata from the API:
     - 'title': from info['title']
     - 'description': from info.get('description')
     - 'thumbnail': from info.get('screenshotURI')
     - 'duration': int_or_none(info.get('duration'), 1000)  # converts ms to seconds
     - 'uploader': from info.get('user')
     - 'timestamp': float_or_none(info.get('dateCreated'), 1000)  # ms to seconds
     - 'view_count': int_or_none(info.get('numberOfViews'))
  6. Return the assembled info_dict.

- Important implementation details
  - Uses a two-tier retrieval strategy:
    - Primary: API metadata endpoint (media/<id>/metadata) for reliable fields.
    - Secondary: HTML scraping for direct video URLs if API does not provide mediaURI.
    Tertiary: data-setup JSON extraction from the page for a potential URL inside a JS setup object.
  - Ext inference:
    - When a direct URL is found via API or HTML, sets ext to 'flv' (or uses provided URL to determine format later).
    - If URL-transparently derived via data-setup, relies on that external source (URL is provided, actual ext inferred elsewhere).
  - Robust metadata extraction with utility helpers:
    - int_or_none and float_or_none convert numeric fields with optional multipliers (e.g., 1000 for ms to seconds).
  - The code is careful to only reference 'webpage' when it has been downloaded (to avoid NameError).

Overall, the extractor targets dotsub video pages by first querying a metadata API, then gracefully falling back to HTML/JS-based extraction to obtain a direct video URL, while still enriching the resulting info with standard fields like title, description, duration, uploader, timestamp, and view count.
