Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/slutload.py

What it does
- Implements a YouTube-dl extractor for slutload.com videos (SlutloadIE).
- Supports extracting video information from two page formats:
  - The embed_player page (embedded player) that may contain direct video URLs.
  - The regular video page (video/_/{id}/) that provides HTML5 video entries.

Key class and methods
- SlutloadIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Regular expression matching slutload video pages, embed pages, and watch pages. Captures the video id as 'id'.
  - _TESTS: A set of example URLs with expected results to validate extraction, including:
    - A standard video page returning id, mp4 ext, title, 18+ age_limit, and a thumbnail URL pattern.
    - Some “only_matching” tests for other variants (mobile site, embed, watch) to ensure URL matching works without full extraction.
  - _real_extract(self, url):
    - Derives video_id from the URL using _match_id.
    - Attempts to fetch the embed page: http://www.slutload.com/embed_player/{video_id} with fatal=False (so it won’t crash if unavailable).
    - If embed_page exists:
      - Defines helper extract(what) to pull data-video-<what> attributes from the embed page using a regex that handles quoted values robustly.
      - video_url = extract('url')
      - If video_url found:
        - title extracted from the embed page’s <title> tag (fallback to video_id if missing).
        - Return a dict: id, url (video_url), title, thumbnail (extract('preview')), age_limit: 18.
    - If embed approach fails or no video_url:
      - Fetch the standard video page: http://www.slutload.com/video/_/{video_id}/
      - Extract title from <h1><strong>Title</strong></h1> and strip whitespace.
      - Use _parse_html5_media_entries(url, webpage, video_id) to obtain HTML5 video entries; take the first one [0].
      - Update that info dict with id, title, and age_limit: 18.
      - Return the info dict.

Important implementation details
- Robust URL handling: _VALID_URL covers three page types (video, embed_player, watch) and subdomains (including mobile.slutload.com) via (?:\w+\.)?.
- Embed page extraction path:
  - The inner extract function reads attributes data-video-url and data-video-preview from the embed page using a careful regex pattern to correctly capture quoted URLs.
  - If a video URL is found on the embed page, the extractor returns a compact metadata dict with id, url, title, thumbnail, and age_limit.
- Fallback path:
  - If the embed page isn’t usable, the extractor falls back to parsing the standard video page.
  - It pulls the main title from the page and delegates to _parse_html5_media_entries to get actual video URLs and formats, then augments the result with id and title.
- Age restriction: Both paths set age_limit to 18, indicating explicit content.
- Resilience: The embed fetch uses fatal=False to avoid errors if the embed page is unavailable, allowing a graceful fallback to the regular video page.
- Metadata returned:
  - Primary path returns: id, url, title, thumbnail (optional), age_limit.
  - Fallback path returns the first HTML5 media entry augmented with id, title, age_limit.

Overall, this extractor provides two strategies to obtain a direct video URL from slutload: first try the embed-based URL extraction, then fall back to parsing the standard video page’s HTML5 media entries, with appropriate title and metadata extraction.
