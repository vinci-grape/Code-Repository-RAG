Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/varzesh3.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-dl extractor (Varzesh3IE) for videos hosted on video.varzesh3.com.

- Class and inheritance
  - Varzesh3IE inherits from InfoExtractor.
  - Provides a dedicated _real_extract implementation to fetch and parse video pages.

- URL matching and tests
  - _VALID_URL: Matches Varzesh3 video pages with a slug-like path and captures an id component.
  - _TESTS: Includes two tests
    - A real URL test that expects an mp4 video, with title, description, and thumbnail; marked to skip on HTTP 404.
    - A second test that expects a description to be missing and warns accordingly.

- Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
  - display_id: Extracted from the URL via _match_id.
  - webpage: HTML content downloaded with _download_webpage.
  - video_url: Found by locating a <source> tag with a src attribute via a regex.
  - title: Extracted from the <title> tag, then cleaned by removing a leading prefix "ویدیو ورزش 3 | ".
  - description:
    - First tries to extract from a div with class "matn" using _html_search_regex.
    - If not found, falls back to the Open Graph description meta via _html_search_meta('description') and cleans it.
  - thumbnail:
    - First attempts to use the Open Graph thumbnail via _og_search_thumbnail.
    - If not available, tries to locate a Facebook sharer URL on the page, parses its query string, and extracts p[images][0] as a fallback thumbnail.
  - video_id:
    - Primary method: search for a link tag with rel "canonical" or "shortlink" whose href contains "/?p=...".
    - If not found, fall back to extracting a JavaScript variable: var VideoId = <digits>;
  - Output: Returns a dict with
    - url: video_url
    - id: video_id
    - title: title
    - description: description
    - thumbnail: thumbnail

- Key implementation details
  - Uses compatibility helpers: compat_urllib_parse_urlparse and compat_parse_qs to parse URLs and query strings.
  - Uses utility functions: remove_start to strip a known prefix from the page title; clean_html to sanitize HTML from metadata.
  - Robust metadata extraction:
    - Title normalization to remove site prefix.
    - Description fallback strategy to ensure some description is returned when possible.
    - Thumbnail fallback path: og:image first, then Facebook sharer URL parameter p[images][0].
  - Video ID resolution includes a primary path via canonical/shortlink href and a fallback via a JavaScript variable, increasing resilience to page structure changes.

- Notable behaviors
  - If the page does not contain a direct video URL in a <source> tag, extraction would fail at that step.
  - The tests indicate handling for missing descriptions (warning) and 404 pages (skip).

- Overall role
  - This extractor encapsulates the logic to retrieve the direct video URL and associated metadata from Varzesh3 video pages, producing a standard info dictionary compatible with youtube-dl’s downstream processing.
