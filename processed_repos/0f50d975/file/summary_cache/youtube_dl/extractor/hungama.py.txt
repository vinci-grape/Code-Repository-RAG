- Purpose
  - Implements two extractors for Hungama content in youtube-dl:
    - HungamaIE: extracts video/movie and TV show episode streams
    - HungamaSongIE: extracts song audio streams

- Key classes
  - HungamaIE (InfoExtractor)
  - HungamaSongIE (InfoExtractor)

- URL patterns (_VALID_URL)
  - HungamaIE: matches Hungama video pages, movie pages, or TV-show episode pages and captures an id at the end
  - HungamaSongIE: matches Hungama song pages and captures the numeric id

- Main functionality (how extraction works)
  - HungamaIE
    - Extracts video_id from the URL
    - Downloads the page and reads JSON-LD metadata
    - Retrieves the actual video stream URL by POSTing to https://www.hungama.com/index.php with:
      - content_id = video_id
      - headers: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8, X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
      - query parameters: c=common, m=get_video_mdn_url
    - The response contains stream_url (m3u8 URL)
    - Derives formats using _extract_m3u8_formats with:
      - ext='mp4', entry_protocol='m3u8_native', m3u8_id='hls'
    - Sorts formats and returns an info dict updated with id and formats (plus any metadata found in JSON-LD)
  - HungamaSongIE
    - Extracts audio_id from the URL
    - Fetches track data from https://www.hungama.com/audio-player-data/track/{audio_id} with country query _country=IN
    - Reads track name and singer (artist)
    - Determines m3u8 URL from data['file'] or data['preview_link'], by fetching its JSON and reading response.media_url
    - Derives formats via _extract_m3u8_formats with the same m3u8 options as above
    - Builds a title as "artist - track" if artist exists, otherwise just track
    - Chooses thumbnail from data['img_src'] or data['album_image']
    - Returns an info dict with id, title, thumbnail, track, artist, album, release_year (int if present), and formats

- Important implementation details
  - Uses _search_json_ld to obtain initial metadata, then enriches/overwrites with formats and IDs
  - Uses urlencode_postdata for the POST payload when fetching the MDN URL
  - Uses specific headers for the MDN URL request to mimic an AJAX request
  - Formats extraction relies on HLS (m3u8) and uses entry_protocol='m3u8_native'
  - Release year conversion uses int_or_none to safely parse numeric values
  - Tests:
    - HungamaIE includes a real video example with md5 and expected info_dict
    - Tests also include only_matching for URLs that should be matched but not fully extracted in some cases

- Return values
  - HungamaIE: info dict containing id and formats (plus any metadata from JSON-LD like title, artist, album, release_year, etc.)
  - HungamaSongIE: info dict containing id, title, thumbnail, track, artist, album, release_year, and formats

- Overall
  - The file provides concrete extractors to fetch streaming data from Hungamaâ€™s video and song pages, handling metadata extraction, MDN URL retrieval, and HLS-based format parsing.
