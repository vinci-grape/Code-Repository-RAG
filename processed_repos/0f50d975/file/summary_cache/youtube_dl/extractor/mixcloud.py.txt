Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/mixcloud.py

Purpose
- Implement Mixcloud extractors for youtube-dl to fetch:
  - Individual cloudcasts (MixcloudIE)
  - User-related collections (uploads/favorites/listens/stream) via MixcloudUserIE
  - Playlists (MixcloudPlaylistIE)
- Uses Mixcloud’s GraphQL API to retrieve data and decrypts certain media URLs to build downloadable formats.

Key classes and their roles
- MixcloudBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - _call_api(object_type, object_fields, display_id, username, slug=None)
    - Builds and sends a GraphQL query to https://app.mixcloud.com/graphql.
    - object_type can be 'cloudcast', 'playlist', or 'user' (via lookup keys like cloudcastLookup, playlistLookup, etc.).
    - Returns the data for the requested object, used by concrete extractors to fetch details.

- MixcloudIE (for single cloudcasts)
  - _DECRYPTION_KEY: a fixed string used to decrypt certain media URLs.
  - _decrypt_xor_cipher(key, ciphertext): staticmethod
    - XOR-decrypts a ciphertext with a repeating key. Used to decrypt base64-encoded media URLs.
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts username and slug from the URL, builds a track_id as "username_slug".
    - Fetches cloudcast metadata via _call_api('cloudcast', ...).
    - Processes stream URLs (streamInfo: url, hlsUrl, dashUrl):
      - If hlsUrl or dashUrl exist, decrypts URL with XOR cipher and base64, then builds formats:
        - hlsUrl -> m3u8 formats via _extract_m3u8_formats
        - dashUrl -> MPD formats via _extract_mpd_formats
      - url -> direct HTTP format with a throttled http_chunk_size.
    - If no formats and cloudcast is marked exclusive, prompts login.
    - Sorts formats and collects metadata:
      - title, description, thumbnail, uploader (owner), uploader_id, uploader_url
      - timestamp, duration, view_count, like_count, repost_count, comment_count
      - comments: parsed from cloudcast['comments'] edges (author, author_id, text, timestamp)
      - tags: extracted from cloudcast['tags']
      - artist: joined featuringArtistList
    - Returns a dict with id, title, formats, and all metadata.

- MixcloudPlaylistBaseIE (Base for user/playlist collections)
  - _get_cloudcast(node): returns the node as-is by default; can be overridden by child classes.
  - _get_playlist_title(title, slug): returns title by default; overridden to include slug for user playlists.
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Uses the class’s _VALID_URL and root type to determine if it’s a user playlist or a playlist.
    - Iteratively fetches items/pages via GraphQL (pagination with endCursor) until hasNextPage is false.
    - For each edge/node:
      - Extracts cloudcast data and URL, builds a video_id from owner username and cloudcast slug.
      - Creates a URL result pointing to MixcloudIE for the cloudcast.
    - Returns a playlist result with all collected entries and the constructed playlist title/description.

- MixcloudUserIE (inherits MixcloudPlaylistBaseIE)
  - _VALID_URL matches a Mixcloud user page: https://mixcloud.com/{user}/{type}? (type in uploads|favorites|listens|stream)
  - _TITLE_KEY = 'displayName', _DESCRIPTION_KEY = 'biog', _ROOT_TYPE = 'user'
  - _NODE_TEMPLATE defines fields to fetch per user item (slug, url, owner username)
  - _get_playlist_title(self, title, slug): returns "title (slug)"
  - Uses MixcloudPlaylistBaseIE machinery to fetch and render user-related playlists.

- MixcloudPlaylistIE (inherits MixcloudPlaylistBaseIE)
  - _VALID_URL matches a Mixcloud playlist URL: https://mixcloud.com/{user}/playlists/{playlist}
  - _TITLE_KEY = 'name', _DESCRIPTION_KEY = 'description', _ROOT_TYPE = 'playlist'
  - _NODE_TEMPLATE fetches cloudcast sub-objects: cloudcast { slug, url, owner { username } }
  - _get_cloudcast(self, node): returns node.get('cloudcast') or {}
  - Uses MixcloudPlaylistBaseIE machinery to render a playlist of cloudcasts.

Important implementation details
- GraphQL data access
  - The code uses a single helper to fetch data from Mixcloud’s GraphQL endpoint, constructing queries with specific object types (cloudcast, user, playlist) and requested fields.
  - GraphQL response shape is navigated to extract needed properties (e.g., cloudcast.name, cloudcast.streamInfo, cloudcast.owner, etc.).

- Media URL decryption
  - Some Mixcloud media URLs (hlsUrl, dashUrl, and possibly url) are base64-encoded and XOR-encrypted with a fixed key (IFYOUWANTTHEARTISTSTOGETPAIDDONOTDOWNLOADFROMMIXCLOUD).
  - The code base64-decodes and then XOR-decrypts to obtain usable URLs.
  - After decryption, HLS uses m3u8 formats, DASH uses MPD formats, and HTTP URLs are added as standard formats with throttling considerations to avoid throttling by Mixcloud.

- Formats handling
  - HLS: _extract_m3u8_formats with entry_protocol='m3u8_native' and m3u8_id='hls'.
  - DASH: _extract_mpd_formats with mpd_id='dash'.
  - HTTP: direct URLs with http_chunk_size throttling (5 MB chunks) to mitigate throttling.

- Exclusive content handling
  - If no formats are produced and cloudcast['isExclusive'] is true, the extractor raises a login_required error.

- Metadata extraction
  - Cloudcast metadata includes:
    - title (name)
    - description
    - thumbnail (picture.url)
    - uploader/uploader_id/uploader_url (owner fields)
    - timestamp/publishDate
    - duration (audioLength)
    - view_count (plays)
    - like_count (favorites total)
    - repost_count (reposts total)
    - comment_count (comments total)
    - comments (list of {author, author_id, text, timestamp})
    - tags (list of strings)
    - artist (featuringArtistList joined)
  - The code uses safe access helpers (try_get, int_or_none, parse_iso8601, strip_or_none) to robustly extract data.

- Pagination and playlist construction
  - For playlists and user pages, the code paginates through 100-item chunks and uses the endCursor to fetch the next batch until hasNextPage is false.
  - Each cloudcast is turned into a URL result pointing to MixcloudIE for actual cloudcast extraction, allowing nested extraction behavior.

- Edge handling and robustness
  - Uses compat helpers to support Python 2/3 environments.
  - Decoding/unquoting of URL components is done via compat functions.
  - Missing data is guarded with try_get and fallback defaults.
  - Tests cover several Mixcloud URL patterns and expected metadata shapes.

In short
- This file provides a full Mixcloud extractor system for youtube-dl:
  - MixcloudIE handles a single cloudcast, including decryption of media URLs and multiple formats (HTTP/HLS/DASH) plus rich metadata.
  - MixcloudUserIE and MixcloudPlaylistIE (via MixcloudPlaylistBaseIE) handle user-based collections and playlists, fetching data via GraphQL, paginating through results, and creating playlist entries that link to MixcloudIE for each cloudcast.
