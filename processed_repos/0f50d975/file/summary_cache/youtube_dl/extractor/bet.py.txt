Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/bet.py

What it does
- Implements a YouTube-DL extractor for BET (Bet.com) videos by leveraging MTVN services.
- Extracts video metadata by:
  - loading the BET article/video page
  - pulling a video identifier (mgid) from the page
  - querying a MTVN feed using that mgid
  - taking the first feed entry as the video info dict
  - augmenting that dict with a display_id, description, and upload_date derived from the page

Key components
- BetIE class
  - Inherits from MTVServicesInfoExtractor (reuses common MTVN-based extraction logic)
  - _VALID_URL: Regular expression matching BET article/video URLs ending in .html and capturing an id slug
  - _FEED_URL: "http://feeds.mtvnservices.com/od/feed/bet-mrss-player" – feed endpoint used to obtain video metadata
  - _get_feed_query(self, uri): Returns a dict with {'uuid': uri} used as query parameters for the feed request
  - _extract_mgid(self, webpage): Extracts the mgid by locating data-uri="..."> in the page via a regex
  - _real_extract(self, url): Main extraction flow
    - display_id = self._match_id(url): derives the slug from the URL
    - webpage = self._download_webpage(url, display_id): downloads the page
    - mgid = self._extract_mgid(webpage): gets the mgid from the page
    - videos_info = self._get_videos_info(mgid): fetches video metadata from the MTVN feed
    - info_dict = videos_info['entries'][0]: uses the first feed entry as the video info
    - upload_date = unified_strdate(self._html_search_meta('date', webpage)): converts the page date to the standard YYYYMMDD format
    - description = self._html_search_meta('description', webpage): extracts the page description from meta tags
    - info_dict.update({ 'display_id': display_id, 'description': description, 'upload_date': upload_date }): enriches the info dict
    - return info_dict: final metadata for the video (including fields like id, display_id, ext, title, duration, thumbnail, subtitles, etc.)

Important implementation details
- Uses MTVServicesInfoExtractor infrastructure to handle fed metadata (via _get_videos_info and feed-based retrieval)
- _FEED_URL with query {'uuid': mgid} enables a standardized way to fetch video details from MTVN services
- _extract_mgid relies on a data-uri attribute in the HTML page to locate the mgid
- Date handling via unified_strdate ensures upload_date is returned in the expected format (e.g., 20141208)
- _TESTS provide two sample Bet URLs with expected output, asserting fields like id, display_id, ext, title, description, duration, upload_date, thumbnail, and subtitles; they skip actual downloads to test only extraction logic

Overall
- This extractor focuses on BET pages, uses an mgid obtained from the page to query MTVN’s feed, and returns a comprehensive metadata dictionary for the video, enriched with page-derived fields like display_id, description, and upload_date.
