Summary of file: ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/tudou.py

- Purpose: Implements two extractors for Tudou content in youtube-dl: a playlist extractor and an album extractor.

- TudouPlaylistIE
  - IE_NAME: 'tudou:playlist'
  - _VALID_URL: URLs matching http(s)://(www.)?tudou.com/listplay/<11-char-id>.html
  - _TESTS: Includes a sample Tudou playlist URL and expected id, with a minimum playlist count.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts playlist_id from the URL.
    - Downloads JSON from http://www.tudou.com/tvp/plist.action?lcode=<playlist_id>.
    - Builds a list of entries by converting each item in the JSON's items array into a Tudou program page URL: http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/<icode>.
    - Each entry uses:
      - URL: the program page
      - Extractor: 'Tudou'
      - ID: item['icode']
      - Title: item['kw']
    - Returns a playlist_result containing all entries with the playlist_id as the playlist identifier.

- TudouAlbumIE
  - IE_NAME: 'tudou:album'
  - _VALID_URL: URLs matching http(s)://(www.)?tudou.com/album(cover|play)/<11-char-id>
  - _TESTS: Includes a sample Tudou album URL and expected id, with a minimum item count.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts album_id from the URL.
    - Downloads JSON from http://www.tudou.com/tvp/alist.action?acode=<album_id>.
    - Builds a list of entries similarly to the playlist extractor, converting each item in the JSON's items array into a Tudou program page URL: http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/<icode>.
    - Each entry uses:
      - URL: the program page
      - Extractor: 'Tudou'
      - ID: item['icode']
      - Title: item['kw']
    - Returns a playlist_result containing all entries with the album_id as the playlist identifier.

Implementation details:
- Both extractors rely on icode as the unique video identifier and kw as the video title.
- The program page URL pattern is consistently http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/<icode>.
- JSON endpoints used:
  - Playlist: plist.action?lcode=<id>
  - Album: alist.action?acode=<id>
- Uses base class InfoExtractor utilities: _match_id, _download_json, url_result, and playlist_result.
