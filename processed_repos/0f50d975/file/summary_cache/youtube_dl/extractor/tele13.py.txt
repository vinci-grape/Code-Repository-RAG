Concise summary of tele13.py

Purpose
- Implement a Tele13 video extractor (Tele13IE) for youtube-dl.
- It parses video pages on t13.cl to extract available video formats by reading the JWPlayer setup embedded in the page.

Key components
- Tele13IE (inherits InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Regexp for t13.cl video pages, capturing the video id slug.
  - _TESTS: Includes two example test cases:
    - A direct page with an mp4 (expected md5 and title).
    - A page whose sources point to a YouTube URL (expects Youtube extractor to handle it).

Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
- Determine display_id from URL and download the page HTML.
- Locate the JWPlayer setup object in the page via regex:
  - Looks for jwplayer('player-vivo').setup({ ... })
- Extract the JSON inside the setup() using a regex and parse it safely with js_to_json:
  - Specifically pulls the sources array: sources: [{ file: ..., label: ... }, ...]
- Build formats from the sources:
  - For each source entry:
    - Skip if no file URL or if already processed (deduplicate with a list of seen URLs).
    - Determine the file extension with determine_ext(format_url).
    - If ext is 'm3u8':
      - Use _extract_m3u8_formats to import HLS formats (mp4 container, m3u8_native, m3u8_id='hls', fatal=False).
    - If the URL is a YouTube link (YoutubeIE.suitable(format_url)):
      - Return a Youtube extractor result immediately (delegate to YoutubeIE).
    - Otherwise:
      - Append a direct format dict with: url, format_id (from label), preference (based on the order defined by qualities), and ext.
  - Sort the accumulated formats with _sort_formats.
- Build and return the result dictionary:
  - id: display_id
  - title: extracted from the setup JS (title: "..." pattern)
  - description: from the page meta description (using _html_search_meta)
  - thumbnail: optional value from setup JS (image: "..." pattern)
  - formats: list of gathered formats

Implementation details worth noting
- JSON handling:
  - The code extracts a snippet of the JWPlayer setup and converts embedded JSON (via js_to_json) to a Python object for robust parsing.
- Source handling:
  - Supports multiple formats per video, including direct URLs and HLS (m3u8).
  - Deduplication of format URLs to avoid duplicates.
- Format preferences:
  - Uses qualities(['MÃ³vil', 'SD', 'HD']) to assign a preference to each format label, enabling correct sorting when multiple qualities exist.
- Cross-extractor behavior:
  - If a source URL is a YouTube link, this extractor defers to YouTubeIE by returning self.url_result(format_url, 'Youtube'), allowing seamless integration with the YouTube extractor.
- Robustness:
  - Handles potential 404/page issues via test setup (skip_download in tests).
  - Title and thumbnail extraction rely on patterns within the setup JSON and page metadata, respectively.

In short, Tele13IE scrapes the embedded JWPlayer setup on t13.cl pages to collect all available video sources (HLS, direct URLs, or YouTube links), formats them appropriately, and returns a standard video information structure containing id, title, description, thumbnail, and formats.
