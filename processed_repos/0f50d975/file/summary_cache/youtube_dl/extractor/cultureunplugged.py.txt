- Purpose: A YouTube-DL extractor for Culture Unplugged video pages. It fetches video metadata and streaming URL from cultureunplugged.com.

- Class and inheritance:
  - CultureUnpluggedIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL matching:
  - _VALID_URL matches both with and without a display title segment:
    - Pattern: http(s)://(www.)cultureunplugged.com/documentary/watch-online/play/<id>[/<display_id>]
  - Extracts video_id from the URL and uses display_id if present; otherwise falls back to video_id.

- Tests:
  - _TESTS includes a real example with:
    - MD5 for the MP4, expected fields (id, display_id, ext, title, description, thumbnail, creator, duration, view_count)
  - A second test checking URL matching behavior when display_id is absent (only_matching)

- Main workflow in _real_extract:
  1. Parse URL to obtain video_id and display_id.
  2. Issue a HEAD request to setClientTimezone.php with a timeOffset parameter to obtain a PHPSESSID cookie needed for subsequent JSON retrieval:
     - URL: http://www.cultureunplugged.com/setClientTimezone.php?timeOffset=%d
     - timeOffset is calculated as the negative of (time.timezone / 3600)
     - Uses HEADRequest and _request_webpage for this step.
  3. Download JSON data with movie metadata:
     - URL: http://www.cultureunplugged.com/movie-data/cu-<video_id>.json
     - Uses _download_json.
  4. Extract fields from the JSON:
     - video_url = movie_data['url']
     - title = movie_data['title']
     - description = movie_data.get('synopsis')
     - creator = movie_data.get('producer')
     - duration = int_or_none(movie_data.get('duration'))
     - view_count = int_or_none(movie_data.get('views'))
  5. Build thumbnails list from available thumbnail URLs:
     - Looks for 'small_thumb' and 'large_thumb' in the JSON
     - Creates entries with {'url': ..., 'id': size, 'preference': enumeration_index}
     - Order is small first (preference 0), then large (preference 1) if present
  6. Return the standard info dictionary:
     - id, display_id, url, title, description, creator, duration, view_count, thumbnails
     - The extractor relies on the video URL extension (mp4 in the test) to set ext.

- Important details:
  - The initial HEAD request is required to obtain a session cookie for the subsequent JSON fetch to work correctly.
  - Robust integer parsing via int_or_none for duration and view_count.
  - Thumbnails are optional and built only from available thumb fields.
  - The code uses plain HTTP URLs (not HTTPS) for both the timezone ping and JSON data retrieval.

Overall, this extractor handles Culture Unplugged documentary pages by resolving the metadata JSON after establishing a necessary session, then assembling a complete info_dict suitable for YouTube-DL.
