Concise summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/melonvod.py

Purpose
- Implement a video extractor for Melon VOD (melonvod) to fetch video metadata and streaming formats for a given Melon VOD URL.

Key components
- MelonVODIE(InfoExtractor): Main extractor class.
- _VALID_URL: Regular expression that matches Melon VOD detail URLs and captures mvId as the video id.
- _TEST: Sample test case with a Melon VOD URL and the expected extracted fields (id, ext, title, thumbnail, artist, upload_date, duration) and a download skip hint for m3u8.

Main workflow (_real_extract)
1) Identify video_id
   - Uses self._match_id(url) against _VALID_URL to extract the mvId parameter.

2) Download player information JSON
   - Requests: http://vod.melon.com/video/playerInfo.json
   - Query: mvId=video_id
   - Note: "Downloading player info JSON"
   - Result stored in play_info
   - Extract title from play_info['mvInfo']['MVTITLE']

3) Download streaming information JSON
   - Requests: http://vod.melon.com/delivery/streamingInfo.json
   - Query: contsId=video_id, contsType=VIDEO
   - Note: "Downloading streaming info JSON"
   - Result stored in info
   - stream_info = info['streamingInfo']

4) Build video formats
   - encUrl from stream_info is the HLS manifest URL.
   - Formats are extracted with:
     formats = self._extract_m3u8_formats(stream_info['encUrl'], video_id, 'mp4', m3u8_id='hls')
   - Sort formats for quality/order using self._sort_formats(formats)

5) Artist extraction
   - artist_list = play_info.get('artistList')
   - If artistList is a list, build a comma-separated string of ARTISTNAMEWEBLIST values (only non-empty)
   - Result stored in artist

6) Thumbnail URL
   - thumbnail = urljoin(info.get('staticDomain'), stream_info.get('imgPath'))
   - Combines staticDomain and image path to form a full URL

7) Duration and upload date
   - duration = int_or_none(stream_info.get('playTime'))
   - upload_date = (stream_info.get('mvSvcOpenDt', '')[:8] or None)
     - Uses the first 8 characters (YYYYMMDD) if present

8) Return metadata
   - Return dictionary with:
     - id: video_id
     - title: title
     - artist: artist (may be None if not available)
     - thumbnail: thumbnail URL
     - upload_date: upload_date (YYYYMMDD or None)
     - duration: duration (in seconds or None)
     - formats: list of extracted formats

Implementation details and nuances
- Two-step data ingestion: Uses playerInfo.json for metadata (title, artist) and streamingInfo.json for actual streaming data (encUrl, image path, duration, open date).
- HLS-based formats: EncUrl is treated as an HLS manifest and parsed via _extract_m3u8_formats with mp4 as the default extension and m3u8_id='hls'.
- Robustness in artist extraction: Handles missing or non-list artistList gracefully; constructs a single string if present.
- URL construction: Uses urljoin to safely combine staticDomain with relative image path.
- Data conversion and validation: Uses int_or_none to safely convert duration to integer; slices mvSvcOpenDt to obtain the date portion.
- Ext field in tests: The _TEST expects ext mp4; the extractor returns formats that imply an mp4 container; the ext is typically inferred from formats in youtube-dl tests.

Overall, the extractor fetches metadata from Melonâ€™s JSON endpoints, builds a list of HLS-based formats, and returns a structured dict with id, title, artist, thumbnail, upload date, duration, and formats.
