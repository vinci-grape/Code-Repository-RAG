Here is a concise, focused summary of the Embedly extractor code.

- Purpose
  - Implements an extractor for Embedly widget URLs and delegates extraction to the underlying media URL specified in the widget.

- Key class
  - EmbedlyIE(InfoExtractor)

- Main functionality
  - _VALID_URL: Regex that matches Embedly widget pages like:
    - http(s)://(www|cdn).embedly.com/widgets/media.html?...&url=ENCODED_URL
    - It captures the value of the url parameter (percent-encoded) as the id group.
  - _TESTS: Includes a sample Embedly URL (with many query params) and marks it as only_matching.

- Core logic
  - _real_extract(self, url):
    - Uses _match_id(url) to extract the captured id (the encoded value of the underlying media URL after url=...).
    - Applies compat_urllib_parse_unquote to decode percent-encoding (turns %3A into :) to obtain the actual target URL.
    - Returns self.url_result(target_url), delegating extraction to the appropriate extractor for that URL (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).

- Important implementation details
  - The unquoting uses compat_urllib_parse_unquote to handle Python 3/2 compatibility.
  - The extraction does not itself parse or fetch the media; it simply resolves to the underlying URL and hands control to the corresponding extractor.

- Behavior and edge cases
  - If the Embedly URL contains the actual media URL in the url parameter, this extractor will route to that URLâ€™s own extractor.
  - The code assumes the target URL is properly encoded in the url parameter and decodes it before delegation.

- Example
  - Given an Embedly widget URL with url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSU4fj_aEMVw, the extractor decodes to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU4fj_aEMVw and delegates to the YouTube extractor.

Overall, EmbedlyIE is a lightweight resolver that forwards to the real media URL embedded by Embedly, enabling youtube-dl to apply the appropriate extraction logic for the actual media resource.
