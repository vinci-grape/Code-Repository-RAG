Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/atresplayer.py

- Purpose
  - Implement an InfoExtractor for Atresplayer (atresplayer.com) to fetch episode metadata and video formats via the Atresplayer API, with optional user login support.

- Key class
  - AtresPlayerIE(InfoExtractor)
    - _VALID_URL: Regex matching Atresplayer episode URLs and capturing display_id and a 24-hex-character video id.
    - _NETRC_MACHINE: 'atresplayer' (for credentials lookup).
    - _API_BASE: Base API URL ('https://api.atresplayer.com/').
    - _TESTS: Several test cases verifying extraction, including a login-required skip case and sample URLs.
    - _real_initialize: Triggers login flow by calling _login() before extraction.
    - _handle_error(e, code): Common error handling for HTTP errors:
      - If HTTP 4xx/3xx with API error JSON indicating 'required_registered' => raise login_required.
      - Otherwise raise ExtractorError with API-provided error_description.
    - _login(): Performs user login if credentials are provided.
      - Retrieves credentials via _get_login_info().
      - Requests login page from API_BASE + 'login'.
      - Posts username/password to account.atresmedia.com API login endpoint.
      - Expects a response containing 'targetUrl'; follows it to complete login.
      - Handles 400 errors via _handle_error (to raise appropriate login errors).
      - If no credentials are provided, the function returns without error (login is optional).
    - _real_extract(url): Core extraction logic.
      - Parse display_id and video_id from the URL using _VALID_URL.
      - Fetch episode metadata from API_BASE + 'client/v1/player/episode/{video_id}'.
      - If a 403/authorization error occurs, handle via _handle_error.
      - Title is episode['titulo'].
      - Build video formats from episode['sources']:
        - If type is 'application/vnd.apple.mpegurl' (HLS), use _extract_m3u8_formats with m3u8_native, and alias as hls.
        - If type is 'application/dash+xml' (DASH), use _extract_mpd_formats.
        - Both format extractions use fatal=False to allow partial success.
      - _sort_formats(formats).
      - Compute meta fields: channel, season, episode_number by preferring heartbeat or omniture data.
      - Return a dict with:
        - display_id, id, title, description, thumbnail, duration (int_or_none), formats
        - channel, season, episode_number (from meta)
    - Important behavior:
      - If login is not configured, extraction proceeds without authenticated access (some videos may require login; in tests this leads to a skip message).
      - Video formats may include HLS and DASH streams; both are supported via standard YouTube-DL format extractors.
      - Duration uses int_or_none to safely convert to integer if present.

- Main functionality flow
  - On initialization, attempt login (optional).
  - When extracting, query the Atresplayer API for the episode by video_id.
  - Build a list of available video formats from HLS/DASH sources.
  - Gather metadata (title, description, thumbnail, duration) and optional channel/season/episode_number.
  - Return a structured info dictionary suitable for download by youtube-dl.

- Implementation details worth noting
  - Error handling is designed to interpret API error responses and convert them into user-friendly messages or login prompts.
  - Login flow uses a two-step process: obtain a target URL from the login API and then follow it to finalize authentication.
  - Credentials are read via _get_login_info and are optional; this aligns with test cases that skip extraction when not provided.
  - Formats extraction uses native m3u8 and mpd parsers with fatal=False to avoid failing extraction when some sources are unavailable.
  - The code parses display_id and id from the URL to preserve the user-friendly URL portion while keeping the internal id separate for API calls.

Overall, this extractor fetches episode data from Atresplayerâ€™s API, supports authenticated access when credentials are provided, parses multiple video formats (HLS/DASH), and returns a comprehensive metadata dictionary for downstream processing.
