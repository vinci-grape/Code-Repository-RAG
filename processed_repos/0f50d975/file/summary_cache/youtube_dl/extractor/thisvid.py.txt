This file implements three ThisVid extractors for youtube-dl: ThisVidIE (single video or embedded video), ThisVidMemberIE (member/profile pages with lists of videos), and ThisVidPlaylistIE (playlist pages). The extractors work together to locate video URLs, gather metadata, and delegate actual video extraction to the Generic/other extractors as needed.

Key components

- ThisVidIE (InfoExtractor)
  - URL patterns: _VALID_URL matches either /videos/<id> or /embed/<id>.
  - Purpose: extract metadata for a single ThisVid video (or embed) and then return a url_transparent result to let the Generic extractor fetch the actual video.
  - Main logic:
    - Download page; extract title via a flexible <title> regex.
    - If URL is an embed, try to find video_alt_url to redirect to the main page; if present and different, re-download that page.
    - Detect private videos by looking for a “This video is a private video” marker in the video-holder section; raise login_required with an appropriate message if found.
    - Extract uploader information with a regex that captures a numeric uploader_id and a slug; split and normalize to None if missing.
    - Return a merged dict containing:
      - _type: 'url_transparent'
      - title, age_limit (18), uploader, uploader_id
      - plus the original URL passed to a downstream Generic extractor (url_result(url, ie='Generic'))
  - Notable details:
    - Uses get_element_by_class and clean_html to parse the page safely.
    - The output is a url_transparent entry, deferring actual video URL extraction to the Generic extractor.

- ThisVidMemberIE (InfoExtractor)
  - URL pattern: /members/<id>
  - Purpose: treat a member page as a playlist-like collection of ThisVid video URLs, with support for pagination and both member-list and playlist-like pages.
  - Key methods:
    - _urls(self, html): finds all links on the page that match ThisVidIE’s URL structure and yields them.
    - _real_extract(self, url):
      - Determine playlist id from URL and download the page.
      - Derive a plausible playlist title from OpenGraph title or <title>, trimming a possible trailing “| ThisVid.com” suffix.
      - Nested generator entries(page_url, html=None) implements pagination:
        - Downloads subsequent pages as needed (with notes when fetching).
        - Yields video URLs found on each page via _urls(html).
        - Pagination logic handles two cases:
          - Member list pages with a “pagination-next” element; extracts next-page URL from the next link.
          - Playlist pages without a next link: manually increments the numeric page in the path to build the next page URL; stops when there is no further page.
      - Returns a playlist from matches with:
        - playlist_id = pl_id
        - playlist_title = title
        - ie = 'ThisVid'
  - Notable details:
    - Uses a flexible approach to pagination to support both member lists and direct playlists.
    - Aggregates metadata for the playlist via the parent logic and yields individual video URLs to be processed by ThisVidIE/Generic.

- ThisVidPlaylistIE (ThisVidMemberIE subclass)
  - URL pattern: /playlist/<id>/video/<video_id>
  - Purpose: extract a playlist containing a sequence of videos, with an option to fetch only the featured video via --no-playlist.
  - Key methods:
    - _get_video_url(self, pl_url): converts a playlist URL to the corresponding video URL by substituting the path to /videos/<video_id>/.
    - _urls(self, html): finds links on the playlist page that match the ThisVidPlaylistIE URL pattern and converts them to actual video URLs using _get_video_url.
    - _real_extract(self, url):
      - pl_id = playlist id from URL.
      - If noplaylist is set, fetch only the featured video URL and return a ThisVid extractor result for that single video.
      - Otherwise, delegate to the parent (ThisVidMemberIE) to extract a full playlist, then normalize the title if it appears in a duplicated “the title - the title” form:
        - If title length is odd and the middle character is a dash, split into two halves and set the title to the first half if both halves match after stripping.
  - Notable details:
    - Provides a seamless way to access a single featured video from a playlist when --no-playlist is used.
    - Post-processes the playlist title to fix a common duplication formatting issue.

Implementation details and edge cases

- Metadata extraction:
  - Title extraction uses a resilient pattern for both direct pages and embeds.
  - Uploader data is parsed from a specific HTML pattern (Added by: <a class="author" href="https://thisvid.com/members/...">) and split to obtain uploader_id and uploader; missing parts yield None.
  - Private videos trigger login_required, with a message derived from the video-holder content.

- Video URL handling:
  - For embeds, a video_alt_url can point to the main video page; the code redirects if found.
  - The final video URL delivery uses a url_transparent dict pointing to a Generic/other extractor to obtain the actual video file/stream.

- Pagination logic:
  - Member pages: supports both a typical “next” button and a non-standard pagination scenario by building the next page URL from the current URL’s path.
  - Playlist pages: when no explicit next link is present, increments the numeric segment of the path to move to the next page.

- Tests:
  - The _TESTS cover both direct video and embed cases, including metadata like title, description (md5), thumbnail, uploader info, and age_limit.
  - Playlist tests cover a playlist with multiple items and a single featured video via noplaylist.

In short, this file provides a robust Three-in-One ThisVid extraction strategy:
- ThisVidIE handles single videos/embeds and defers to a Generic extractor with added metadata.
- ThisVidMemberIE crawls member pages to collect video entries and supports pagination for both member lists and playlists.
- ThisVidPlaylistIE handles explicit playlist pages, supports the no-playlist behavior to fetch only the featured video, and cleans up titles when needed.
