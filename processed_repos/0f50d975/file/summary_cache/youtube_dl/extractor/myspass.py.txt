Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/myspass.py

- Purpose
  - Implement an extractor for MySpass video pages to obtain metadata and a direct video URL for download.

- Main class
  - MySpassIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL pattern and testing
  - _VALID_URL: Matches MySpass video pages and captures the numeric video id at the end of the path.
  - _TEST: Provides a sample URL, expected md5 of the video, and an info_dict with id, ext, title, description, and thumbnail for testing.

- Core functionality (_real_extract)
  - Extracts video_id from the URL using _match_id.
  - Downloads metadata XML from:
    http://www.myspass.de/myspass/includes/apps/video/getvideometadataxml.php?id=<video_id>
  - Parses metadata XML to extract:
    - title (fatal if missing)
    - url_flv (video URL; attempts to fallback via 'download url' label and requires it present)
    - imagePreview (thumbnail)
    - description
    - duration (parsed with parse_duration)
    - format (used as series)
    - season (converted to int for season_number)
    - season_id
    - episode (set to title)
    - episode (number, parsed as int for episode_number)
  - Post-processing of video URL to fix path segments:
    - Looks for numeric groups in the URL matching the pattern /myspass2009/<digits>/<digits>/<digits>/
    - Replaces any group that is greater than the numeric video_id with group_int // video_id_int (integer division)
    - This is a workaround to normalize the URLâ€™s path segments to obtain a valid direct video URL.
  - Returns a dict with keys:
    - id, url, title, thumbnail, description, duration, series, season_number, season_id, episode, episode_number
  - The 'ext' key is inferred by youtube-dl from the final URL (as shown in the _TEST with ext 'mp4').

- Key implementation details
  - Uses existing utilities:
    - xpath_text for extracting XML fields
    - int_or_none to safely convert strings to integers
    - parse_duration to convert duration strings to seconds
  - Handles potential absence of certain XML fields gracefully (some fields are optional or have fallbacks).
  - The URL normalization logic relies on integer division and string replacement to adjust path segments in the video URL.

Overall, the extractor fetches MySpass video metadata, derives a direct video URL (with a specific URL-mending heuristic), and returns a structured metadata dictionary suitable for youtube-dl to download the video.
