Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/teamtreehouse.py

What it does
- Implements a Team Tree House extractor (TeamTreeHouseIE) for youtube-dl.
- Handles three content types on teamtreehouse.com/library pages:
  - Individual videos
  - Courses (multiple videos as a playlist)
  - Workshops (another playlist-style collection)
- Supports optional user authentication to access full content; will warn/limit when viewing previews.

Key components and functionality
- Class: TeamTreeHouseIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Matches library pages under teamtreehouse.com/library/{id}
  - _NETRC_MACHINE: 'teamtreehouse' for netrc-based login

- Authentication flow (_real_initialize)
  - If login info is provided, navigates to signin page and builds a login POST using hidden form inputs.
  - Submits user credentials to sign in (person_session).
  - If the response contains an element with class 'error-message', raises an ExtractorError with the error content.
  - This enables access to restricted content when credentials are supplied.

- Main extraction (_real_extract)
  - Fetches page, derives display_id from URL, and extracts:
    - title (og:title or twitter:title)
    - description (description, og:description, or twitter:description)
  - Tries to parse direct media entries via _parse_html5_media_entries.
    - If found (single video or media item):
      - Normalizes subtitles by setting their file extension using determine_ext(subtitle['url'], 'srt').
      - Detects preview mode via data-preview="true":
        - If preview, warns the user and sets duration to 30 seconds.
      - If not preview, tries to read duration from data-duration attribute; fallback to parsing the element with id="video-duration".
      - Returns a dict with id, title, description, duration, and other media info.
    - If not found (no direct video on the page):
      - Builds a playlist by collecting links to videos in two possible ways:
        1) workshop-videos list: looks for a ul with id="workshop-videos" and extracts all hrefs.
        2) syllabus-stages path: looks for a div with id="syllabus-stages" and data-url attribute, downloads that stages page, and extracts chapters and their steps.
      - Internal helper extract_urls(html, extract_info=None):
        - Finds all <a href="..."> links, resolves to absolute URLs, and creates url_transparent entries with:
          - _type: 'url_transparent'
          - url: resolved link
          - id: extracted via _match_id(page_url)
          - id_key: the extractor type
        - If extract_info provided, attaches additional fields (e.g., chapter metadata)
      - If stages are found, iterates over chapters and steps to create entries with chapter_number and chapter metadata.
      - Strips trailing " Course" from the title when building playlists from stages.
      - Returns a playlist_result(entries, display_id, title, description)

Important implementation details
- Subtitle handling: normalizes subtitle extensions with determine_ext, defaulting to 'srt' when uncertain.
- Duration handling:
  - If data-duration attribute present on the page, uses that value (converted from milliseconds if needed).
  - If not, uses the element with id="video-duration" to parse duration.
  - In preview mode, duration is forced to 30 seconds to reflect truncated content.
- Preview behavior: warns users when accessing preview content that requires a Basic account for full access.
- Playlist building:
  - Robust against two layouts: a dedicated workshop videos list or a syllabus stages structure.
  - Uses a nested approach with an inner extract_urls helper to accumulate video entries as url_transparent items.
  - When building from stages, collects Chapter and Chapter Number metadata to enrich entries.
  - Title normalization for playlist pages derived from stages (removes trailing " Course").
- Error handling:
  - If login fails, raises ExtractorError with cleaned HTML of the error message.
- Utilities used:
  - _download_webpage, _html_search_meta, _parse_html5_media_entries, _search_regex, _match_id, _download_webpage, _form_hidden_inputs, clean_html, urlencode_postdata, urljoin, parse_duration, remove_end, determine_ext, get_element_by_class, get_element_by_id, float_or_none, etc.

Tests
- _TESTS include:
  - Course: a course URL with expected multi-video playlist and metadata (id, title, description) and a playlist minimum count.
  - Workshop: a workshop URL with a playlist and metadata.
  - Video: a single video URL with mp4 extension and description, plus a preview warning expectation.

In short
- This extractor handles Team Tree House library pages by:
  - Logging in when credentials are provided
  - Extracting metadata for single videos
  - Detecting and constructing playlists from either workshop video lists or syllabus stages
  - Handling subtitles, duration, preview mode, and chapters/sections metadata
  - Returning either a single video info dict or a playlist of url_transparent entries with enriched metadata.
