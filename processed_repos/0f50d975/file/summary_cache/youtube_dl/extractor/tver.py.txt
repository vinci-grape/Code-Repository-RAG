concise comprehensive summary

- Purpose
  - TVerIE is a YouTube-DL extractor for TVer.jp (Japanese streaming) that handles pages under corner, feature, and episode. It retrieves metadata via TVer API and delegates video playback to Brightcove.

- Core functionality
  - Logs in to TVer API to obtain an access token on initialization.
  - For a given TVer page URL, fetches metadata from https://api.tver.jp/v4/{path} using the token.
  - Builds a Brightcove player URL using publisher_id and a reference_id (with small adjustments based on service).
  - Returns a url_transparent entry that points to BrightcoveNew, exposing description and episode_number when available, and restricting playback to JP geo.

- Key classes / functions
  - TVerIE(InfoExtractor)
    - _VALID_URL: Regex to match TVer URLs for corner/episode/feature pages with an ID (optionally prefixed with 'f').
    - _real_initialize(self): Downloads an access token from https://tver.jp/api/access_token.php and stores it in self._TOKEN.
    - _real_extract(self, url): 
      - Parses path and video_id from URL.
      - Fetches main data from https://api.tver.jp/v4/{path} with the token.
      - Extracts publisher_id (p_id) and service, normalizes service by removing 'ts_' prefix.
      - Determines reference_id (r_id); if service is not one of allowed values, prefixes with 'ref:'.
      - Constructs a Brightcove URL using BRIGHTCOVE_URL_TEMPLATE and wraps it with geo_countries JP via smuggle_url.
      - Returns a dict with:
        - _type: 'url_transparent'
        - url: Brightcove URL
        - ie_key: 'BrightcoveNew'
        - description: main['note'][0]['text'] if available
        - episode_number: integer from main['ext']['episode_number'] if available
  - BRIGHTCOVE_URL_TEMPLATE: Template for Brightcove player URL.
  - _TESTS: Examples of URLs to verify pattern matching (only_matching=True). Indicates 7-day availability note.

- Important implementation details
  - Token handling: Token is fetched once during extractor initialization and reused for the subsequent API call to obtain the main metadata.
  - API interaction: Uses _download_json to fetch API responses; passes token as a query parameter.
  - Data handling: Uses try_get to safely access nested fields (description text, episode_number). Converts episode_number with int_or_none.
  - Service / reference handling: If TVer service is not in the allowed set ('tx', 'russia2018', 'sebare2018live', 'gorin'), the reference_id is prefixed with 'ref:' to form a valid Brightcove videoId.
  - Geo restriction: Brightcove URL is wrapped with geo_countries JP to enforce Japanese geo restrictions.
  - Output: The extractor uses a transparent URL type pointing to BrightcoveNew, enabling the standard Brightcove video extraction pipeline.

- Behavior notes
  - The extractor does not directly return a playable video URL; it provides a Brightcove URL via a url_transparent entry so the BrightcoveNew extractor handles playback.
  - The code accounts for optional fields, avoiding crashes when description or episode_number are missing.
