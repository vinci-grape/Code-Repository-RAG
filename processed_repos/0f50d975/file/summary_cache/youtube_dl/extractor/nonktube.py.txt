Concise summary:

- Purpose: A YouTube-DL extractor for the nonktube.com site to fetch video metadata using the Nuevo framework.

- Class and inheritance: NonkTubeIE(NuevoBaseIE) extends NuevoBaseIE, leveraging its HTML5 media parsing utilities.

- URL matching: _VALID_URL recognizes video and embed pages on nonktube.com (including legacy embed with id param) and captures the numeric video id as id.

- Tests: _TESTS includes:
  - A typical video page returning id, ext (mp4), title, duration, and age_limit.
  - An embed URL covered by the same pattern (only_matching test).

- Core extraction (_real_extract):
  - Extracts video_id via _match_id(url).
  - Downloads the page with _download_webpage.
  - Retrieves the OpenGraph title with _og_search_title.
  - Parses HTML5 video entries with _parse_html5_media_entries(url, webpage, video_id) and takes the first entry as info.
  - Updates info with:
    - id: video_id
    - title: og:title-derived title
    - age_limit: 18
  - Returns the info dictionary (which already includes fields like ext and duration from the HTML5 parsing).

- Key behavior details:
  - Relies on NuevoBaseIEâ€™s HTML5 media parsing for core video metadata (e.g., mp4 extension, duration).
  - Adds a fixed age_limit of 18 to comply with adult content rules.
  - Title is sourced from og:title, ensuring a clean, human-readable title.
