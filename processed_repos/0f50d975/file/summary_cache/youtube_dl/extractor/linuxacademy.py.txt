Concise but comprehensive summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/linuxacademy.py

Overview
- This file defines LinuxAcademyIE, a Youtube-DL info extractor for Linux Academy course/lesson pages.
- Supports two primary URL patterns:
  - Course lesson path: https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/{chapter_id}/lesson/{lesson_id}/module/{module_id}
  - Module view path: https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/{course_id}
- Handles both a single video (with m3u8/HLS formats) and a course playlist composed of multiple lessons.

Main class and structure
- LinuxAcademyIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Regular expression to match Linux Academy CP course/lesson/module URLs. Uses named groups: chapter_id, lesson_id, course_id.
  - _TESTS: Several test cases demonstrating single video and playlist extraction, including expectations for id, title, description, duration, timestamps, and skip conditions (requires login).
  - _AUTHORIZE_URL, _ORIGIN_URL, _CLIENT_ID, _NETRC_MACHINE: OAuth/login related constants used for automated login.
  - _real_initialize: Invokes _login() to perform user authentication before extraction.
  - _login: Performs a full OAuth-like login flow against Linux Academy:
    - Obtains username/password via _get_login_info().
    - Starts authorization flow by requesting the authorize URL with client_id, response_type, etc., including a random state/nonce.
    - Extracts login data from the returned page (an atob-encoded JSON blob), decodes it, and augments it with credentials and connection details.
    - Posts login data to the Username-Password login endpoint; handles HTTP 401 to surface a friendly ExtractorError with the server-provided message.
    - Completes login via a callback step and exchanges for an access token from the redirect URL or an authorizationResponse payload.
    - Validates the token by requesting a token validation URL.
  - _real_extract: Core extraction logic after authentication:
    - Parses the URL to decide between a course path (course_id present) and a single video path.
  
Two main extraction paths

1) Course/playlist path (course_id present)
- Parses module data from window.module JSON embedded in the webpage.
- Builds a playlist of lesson entries by iterating module items:
  - Recognizes sections to denote chapters, tracking chapter title, id, and numbering.
  - Skips non-lesson items; for each lesson, constructs a URL using urljoin.
  - Extracts title, description (md_desc or cleaned HTML), timestamp (unified_timestamp), duration (parse_duration).
  - Creates entries of type _type: 'url_transparent' with:
    - url: lesson URL
    - ie_key: LinuxAcademyIE (recursive extraction)
    - title, description, timestamp, duration, and chapter information (chapter, chapter_id, chapter_number)
- Returns a playlist dict:
  - _type: 'playlist'
  - entries: list of constructed lesson entries
  - id: course_id
  - title: module['title']
  - description: module['md_desc'] or cleaned module['desc']
  - duration: duration parsed from module
- Notes:
  - Robust parsing with type checking and fallbacks.
  - Uses helper functions: unified_timestamp, parse_duration, clean_html, urljoin, _parse_json, _search_regex.

2) Single video path (no course_id)
- Extracts m3u8 playlist URL from the page:
  - Finds player.playlist JSON array, parses to obtain the first itemâ€™s 'file' URL as m3u8_url.
- Extracts formats with _extract_m3u8_formats using:
  - m3u8_native, entry_protocol='m3u8_native'
  - m3u8_id='hls'
- Sorts formats with _sort_formats and initializes info with id and formats.
- Attempts to enrich info with lesson metadata:
  - Looks for window.lesson or player.lesson JSON objects (via multiple possible patterns); if found, sets:
    - title, description, timestamp, duration
- If no title yet, tries to extract a title from the page with regexes (e.g., "Lecture: ..." or lessonName variable).
- Returns info dict:
  - id: item_id (constructed as course_id or "chapterid-lessonid")
  - formats: list of video formats
  - title/description/timestamp/duration if available from lesson data

Important implementation details
- Login flow and automation:
  - Uses OAuth-like authorize endpoint to obtain a login state, then decodes a base64-encoded login data blob from the page.
  - Posts credentials to Linux Academy login endpoint and handles failures gracefully, surfacing user-friendly errors when credentials are invalid or prohibited.
  - Finalizes login by hitting a token validation endpoint to ensure authenticated access for subsequent extractions.
- URL and content parsing:
  - Uses a combination of _search_regex with multiple fallbacks to locate JSON objects (module, lesson) embedded in the page.
  - Uses _parse_json with a safe default to avoid fatal errors if the expected JSON is not present.
  - Uses js_to_json to convert JavaScript-like JSON fragments to Python dictionaries when needed.
- Data extraction and types:
  - Tightly decouples course playlist extraction from individual lesson extraction.
  - For playlists, each entry includes chapter metadata to preserve structure.
  - Dates/timestamps normalized with unified_timestamp; durations parsed with parse_duration.
  - Descriptions are cleaned using clean_html to remove extraneous markup.
- Resilience and fallbacks:
  - Multiple patterns used to locate lesson data (window.lesson, player.lesson, etc.).
  - If the primary title is missing, secondary regex-based extraction is attempted.
  - Handles missing or malformed data gracefully without crashing extraction.

Summary of key methods
- _real_initialize: triggers login before any extraction.
- _login: performs asynchronous login flow via web requests, handles errors, and stores authenticated session.
- _real_extract: main entry point for URL-specific extraction; branches into:
  - Course/playlist extraction: builds a structured playlist from module data.
  - Single video extraction: derives stream formats and metadata from the m3u8 playlist and optional lesson data.

Overall purpose
- To enable Youtube-DL to download and/or catalog content from Linux Academy, supporting both course-level playlists and individual video lessons, with automated login for access where required.
