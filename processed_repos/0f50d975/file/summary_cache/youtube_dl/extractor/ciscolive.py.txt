Here is a concise but comprehensive summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/ciscolive.py.

Overview
- Implements Cisco Live extractors that fetch metadata for Cisco Live sessions and search results by querying Cisco’s RainFocus API and then delegating video extraction to Brightcove.
- Two main extractors:
  - CiscoLiveSessionIE: extracts a single Cisco Live session and returns a Brightcove video via a url_transparent result.
  - CiscoLiveSearchIE: extracts a paginated list of sessions from a search query and yields Brightcove-based items as a playlist.

Key classes
- CiscoLiveBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Encapsulates common RainFocus API interaction and item parsing.
  - Constants:
    - RAINFOCUS_API_URL: base RainFocus API URL.
    - RAINFOCUS_API_PROFILE_ID, RAINFOCUS_WIDGET_ID: required identifiers for requests.
    - BRIGHTCOVE_URL_TEMPLATE: Brightcove player URL format using videoId.
  - HEADERS: default HTTP headers for API calls, including Origin, rfApiProfileId, and rfWidgetId.
  - _call_api(ep, rf_id, query, referrer, note=None): performs a POST-like call to the RainFocus API endpoint ep with given query, using headers including Referer. Returns JSON.
  - _parse_rf_item(rf_item): converts a RainFocus item to a youtube-dl compatible result:
    - Extracts title, abstract (HTML-cleaned), first presenter, first video URL (Brightcove video ID), duration (seconds), and location.
    - Returns a url_transparent result pointing to Brightcove (ie_key 'BrightcoveNew') with metadata: title, description, duration, creator, location, and series (eventName).

- CiscoLiveSessionIE (CiscoLiveBaseIE)
  - _VALID_URL: matches Cisco Live session pages of the form ...#/session/<id>.
  - _TESTS: includes a sample with expected metadata (id, title, description, timestamp, uploader, location, etc.).
  - _real_extract(url): extracts RainFocus id, calls _call_api('session', rf_id, {'id': rf_id}, url), and returns the parsed item via _parse_rf_item(rf_result['items'][0]).

- CiscoLiveSearchIE (CiscoLiveBaseIE)
  - _VALID_URL: matches on-demand library search URLs (global or non-global).
  - _TESTS: include a search query example returning a playlist and some only_matching cases.
  - suitable(cls, url): only active if CiscoLiveSessionIE.suitable(url) is False; prevents overlap with session extractor.
  - _check_bc_id_exists(rf_item): ensures the item has a valid Brightcove video id.
  - _entries(self, query, url): generator that pages through search results:
    - Initializes query with size=50 and from=0.
    - Iterates pages via _call_api('search', None, query, url, ...).
    - Some responses use a nested sectionList[0]; they unwrap it if present.
    - Filters items to those with a valid Brightcove id, then yields _parse_rf_item(item).
    - Adjusts query['size'] if the response provides a size; stops when reached total.
  - _real_extract(self, url):
    - Parses query string from the URL, sets query['type']='session', and returns a playlist_result from _entries, titled 'Search query'.

Important implementation details
- Brightcove integration:
  - Cisco Live items point to Brightcove videos. The extractor uses a url_transparent result with ie_key 'BrightcoveNew' and a constructed Brightcove URL using the videoId from rf_item['videos'][0]['url'].
- RainFocus API usage:
  - All API calls go through _call_api, which posts the query data (urlencoded) with headers including Origin and profile/widget IDs.
  - For sessions, the query is {'id': rf_id}; for search, the query is populated from the page’s URL query string, and later augmented with type='session'.
- Data extraction:
  - Uses clean_html to sanitize descriptions.
  - Uses try_get with lambdas to safely navigate nested JSON structures (participants[0].fullName, times[0].length, times[0].room, videos[0].url).
  - duration handling converts lengths (likely minutes) to seconds by multiplying by 60 if present.
  - _check_bc_id_exists ensures items actually have a downloadable Brightcove video.
- URL handling:
  - Session extractor uses URLs with a hash-bang style path (“#/session/…”), which is common in the Cisco Live site.
  - Search extractor handles both global and non-global on-demand-library URLs and uses query parsing to feed the API.

What this code accomplishes
- Provides a clean bridge from Cisco’s RainFocus event data to youtube-dl’s standard extraction framework.
- Centralizes RainFocus API interaction (headers, endpoint construction) in CiscoLiveBaseIE.
- Returns Brightcove-based video entries for both individual sessions and search results, with relevant metadata (title, description, duration, uploader/creator, location, and series).
- Supports pagination and dynamic sizing for search results, emitting a playlist of items that match the user’s search query.
