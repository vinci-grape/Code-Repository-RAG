Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/box.py

Overview
- Implemented BoxIE, a youtube-dl extractor for Box.com shared-file links.
- Subclass of InfoExtractor with URL pattern for Box shared links and a built-in test case.

Key components
- BoxIE class
  - _VALID_URL: Regexp matching Box shared links of the form https://<subdomain>.app.box.com/s/<shared_name>/file/<id>
  - _TEST: Example URL and expected metadata (title, uploader, timestamp, etc.) used for unit testing.

Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
1. Parse URL to obtain:
   - shared_name: the Box shared link identifier
   - file_id: numeric ID of the file

2. Webpage fetch and Box config extraction
   - Download the page content.
   - Extract Box.config JSON via regex Box.config = (...) and parse to obtain requestToken.

3. Acquire end-user access token
   - POST to https://app.box.com/app-api/enduserapp/elements/tokens with JSON body {"fileIDs": [file_id]}.
   - Headers include:
     - Content-Type: application/json
     - X-Request-Token: the previously obtained requestToken
     - X-Box-EndUser-API: sharedName=<shared_name>
   - Response is a JSON mapping from file_id to an object; the code uses the 'read' field as access_token.

4. Prepare shared link and fetch file metadata
   - shared_link = https://app.box.com/s/<shared_name>
   - GET to https://api.box.com/2.0/files/<file_id> with:
     - Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
     - BoxApi: shared_link=<shared_link>
     - X-Rep-Hints: '[dash]' (note: there is a TODO to handle HLS/DASH formats)
     - Query parameters: fields including authenticated_download_url, created_at, created_by, description, extension, is_download_available, name, representations, size
   - Title is taken from f['name'].

5. Build download format(s)
   - Prepare a query dict with:
     - access_token: <access_token>
     - shared_link: <shared_link>
   - If authenticated_download_url exists and is_download_available is true:
     - Create a format dict:
       - ext: f['extension'] or derived from title via determine_ext
       - filesize: f['size']
       - format_id: 'download'
       - url: authenticated_download_url with the query params appended (update_url_query)
   - Note: The code has a placeholder (commented out) for handling DASH/HLS representations, but currently only supports direct authenticated download.

6. Finalize and return metadata
   - Sort the formats with _sort_formats.
   - Extract uploader info from f['created_by'] and fall back gracefully.
   - Return a dict with:
     - id: file_id
     - title
     - formats
     - description (if any)
     - uploader (creator's name)
     - timestamp (parsed from created_at via parse_iso8601)
     - uploader_id (creator's id)

Important implementation details
- Token-based access: The extractor navigates Box’s end-user API to retrieve an access token, then uses that token to obtain file metadata and a downloadable URL.
- Headers and hints: Uses specific headers (X-Request-Token, X-Box-EndUser-API, Authorization: Bearer, BoxApi, X-Rep-Hints) to comply with Box API requirements.
- Formats handling: Currently only supports a single direct download format via authenticated_download_url. The code structure shows planned support for DASH/HLS (represented by a commented-out section and X-Rep-Hints placeholder).
- Utilities used:
  - update_url_query to attach access_token and shared_link to the download URL.
  - determine_ext as fallback when file extension isn’t provided.
  - parse_iso8601 to convert Box timestamps to Unix timestamps.
- Robustness: The extractor assumes the presence of key fields; missing data could raise KeyError or cause fallback behavior depending on availability.

Overall purpose
- Enables youtube-dl to fetch and download Box files via shared links by leveraging Box’s end-user API tokens and constructing a downloadable URL when available, while providing standard metadata (title, uploader, timestamp, description).
