Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/puls4.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for Puls4 (Austrian TV broadcaster) video pages, part of the ProSiebenSat.1 family of extractors.

- Class and inheritance
  - Puls4IE: Inherits from ProSiebenSat1BaseIE, leveraging shared ProSiebenSat1 extraction logic (e.g., _extract_video_info).

- URL matching
  - _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?puls4\.com/(?P<id>[^?#&]+)'
  - Extracts the path after puls4.com as the id used to fetch content.

- Tokens and client info
  - _TOKEN = 'puls4', _SALT = '01!kaNgaiNgah1Ie4AeSha', _CLIENT_NAME = ''
  - These are used by the base extractor for API authentication/signing as needed.

- Core extraction flow (_real_extract)
  1. path = self._match_id(url): get the page path from the URL.
  2. content_path = self._download_json('http://www.puls4.com/api/json-fe/page/' + path, path)['content'][0]['url']
     - Fetches a JSON endpoint for the page and obtains a content URL/path.
  3. media = self._download_json('http://www.puls4.com' + content_path, content_path)['mediaCurrent']
     - Fetches content details and accesses the current media data.
  4. player_content = media['playerContent']
     - Extracts nested player metadata (title, duration, episode, etc.).
  5. info = self._extract_video_info(url, player_content['id'])
     - Uses base class logic to obtain a starting video info dict (formats, IDs, etc.) based on the player content id.
  6. info.update({...}) to enrich with additional metadata:
     - id: media['objectId'] (cast to string)
     - title: player_content['title']
     - description: media.get('description')
     - thumbnail: media.get('previewLink')
     - upload_date: unified_strdate(media.get('date'))
     - duration: parse_duration(player_content.get('duration'))
     - episode: player_content.get('episodePartName')
     - show: media.get('channel')
     - season_id: player_content.get('seasonId')
     - uploader: player_content.get('sourceCompany')
  7. Return the enriched info dict.

- Data and formats
  - Test data (_TESTS) includes a positive test with:
    - URL, expected md5, and info_dict with id, ext, title, description, upload_date, uploader.
  - The extraction yields standard YouTube-DL fields such as id, title, description, thumbnail, upload_date, duration, episode, show, season_id, uploader, plus the base video info (like formats) from _extract_video_info.

- Key implementation details
  - Uses two-step JSON fetching to resolve the actual content path and then the media/current player data.
  - Uses unified_strdate to convert the date to YYYYMMDD format.
  - Uses parse_duration to convert duration into seconds.
  - Uses compat_str to ensure string type for the final id.
  - Handles optional fields with .get to avoid KeyError.

- Overall role
  - Enables downloading and metadata extraction for Puls4 video pages by leveraging the shared ProSiebenSat1 infrastructure and augmenting with Puls4-specific content retrieved from their JSON endpoints.
