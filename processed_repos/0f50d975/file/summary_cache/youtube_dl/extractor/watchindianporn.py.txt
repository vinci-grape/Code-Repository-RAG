concisely but comprehensively summary of the code

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for the site Watch Indian Porn (WatchIndianPornIE). It fetches a video’s metadata and stream information from a specific page pattern and returns a structured info_dict used by the downloader.

- Key class
  - WatchIndianPornIE(InfoExtractor)
    - Inherits common extraction utilities from InfoExtractor.

- Important constants
  - IE_DESC: Description of the extractor ("Watch Indian Porn").
  - _VALID_URL: Regex that identifies eligible video URLs:
    - Matches http/https, optional www., watchindianporn.net, optional path segments, ending with /video/<display_id>-<id>.html
    - Captures:
      - display_id: human-friendly portion before the hyphen
      - id: alphanumeric video identifier
  - _TEST: A unit test dictionary validating extraction for a sample URL.
    - Verifies id, display_id, extension (mp4), title, thumbnail pattern, duration, view_count, categories, and age_limit.

- Main method
  - _real_extract(self, url)
    - Parse URL with _VALID_URL to obtain:
      - video_id = id captured from URL
      - display_id = display_id captured from URL
    - Download the page HTML: webpage = self._download_webpage(url, display_id)
    - Retrieve initial video info:
      - info_dict = self._parse_html5_media_entries(url, webpage, video_id)[0]
        - This pulls video URLs/metadata associated with HTML5 video entries (e.g., format URLs, ext), populating a dict.
    - Title extraction:
      - Attempts two patterns to be robust:
        - <title>... - Indian Porn</title>
        - <h4>...</h4>
      - Uses self._html_search_regex to obtain title.
    - Duration extraction:
      - Looks for a pattern like Time: <strong> ... </strong> and parses it via parse_duration.
      - Uses fatal=False to make it optional.
    - View count extraction:
      - Attempts to extract a numeric view count from a pattern that follows the duration block.
      - Uses fatal=False to tolerate absence.
    - Categories extraction:
      - Collects text content from anchor elements with class="categories" using re.findall.
    - Populate final info_dict with metadata:
      - id, display_id
      - http_headers: Referer set to the page URL (helps with hotlink protections)
      - title, duration, view_count, categories
      - age_limit: 18
    - Return info_dict

- Implementation details and behavior
  - Uses _parse_html5_media_entries to obtain the actual video formats and file extension (e.g., ext 'mp4'), which aligns with the _TEST expectations.
  - Title can come from either the HTML page title or an h4 header, increasing robustness to page structure variations.
  - Duration is parsed from a human-readable Time: section if present.
  - View count is optional; if not present, it won’t crash due to fatal=False.
  - Categories are scraped from links with class="categories".
  - Adds a Referer header for HTTP requests to the video page, which can help the host server serve the correct video resources.
  - The _TEST md5 value is used to verify the downloaded video integrity in test scenarios.

- Overall functionality
  - Given a URL matching the pattern, the extractor:
    - Identifies video_id and display_id
    - Downloads the page
    - Extracts/constructs a complete info_dict including id, display_id, title, duration, view_count, categories, and video formats (via _parse_html5_media_entries)
    - Returns the info_dict suitable for downstream downloading and metadata display.
