Concise summary:

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for Cinemax video pages by leveraging the HBO family extraction logic.

- Key class
  - CinemaxIE(HBOBaseIE): Subclass of HBOBaseIE that specializes in Cinemax URLs and XML metadata endpoints.

- URL matching and routing
  - _VALID_URL: Regular expression that matches Cinemax video pages and captures:
    - path: the portion before the final -<id> (e.g., warrior/video/s1-ep-1-recap)
    - id: the numeric video id at the end of the URL
  - Also accommodates an .embed variant used for matching only (only_matching: True in tests).

- Core functionality
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts path and video_id from the URL using the _VALID_URL regex.
    - Builds the XML metadata endpoint: https://www.cinemax.com/<path>.xml
    - Calls self._extract_info(xml_url, video_id) to obtain a metadata dictionary (inherited from HBOBaseIE).
    - Assigns info['id'] = video_id to ensure the ID matches the numeric identifier from the URL.
    - Returns the info dictionary containing fields like id, ext, title, etc., as provided by the base extractor.

- Implementation details
  - Relies on the HBOBaseIE infrastructure to fetch and parse metadata from the constructed XML endpoint.
  - The test suite includes:
    - A real Cinemax video test with expected id, extension, title, and an MD5 for the video file.
    - An embed URL test marked as only_matching to ensure the pattern recognition works without triggering extraction.

- Notes
  - The code is concise, delegating most of the heavy lifting to the shared HBO extraction logic, with only the URL routing and endpoint construction being Cinemax-specific.
  - Warnings in tests indicate handling of non-standard DASH manifests (e.g., unknown MIME type), which is tolerated by the extractor.
