Concise summary of the code in youtube_dl/extractor/commonprotocols.py

What it does:
- Implements two simple extractors for non-HTTP streaming protocols (RTMP and MMS). Each extractor provides basic metadata (id and title) derived from the URL and exposes the stream URL in a minimal format object (for RTMP) or as a direct URL entry (for MMS).

Key classes and responsibilities:
- RtmpIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Purpose: Handle RTMP(..) URLs.
  - _VALID_URL: Matches RTMP and variants (rtmp, rtmpe, rtmpt, etc.).
  - IE_DESC: False (not listed in the extractor index).
  - _TESTS: Two tests using only_matching to verify URL recognition.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Derives video_id via _generic_id(url) and title via _generic_title(url).
    - Returns a dict with id, title, and a single-format list:
      - format contains the original URL, ext 'flv', and format_id equal to the URL scheme (e.g., 'rtmp', 'rtmpe').
    - Uses compat_urlparse to extract the scheme for format_id.

- MmsIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Purpose: Handle MMS URLs.
  - _VALID_URL: Matches MMS URLs.
  - IE_DESC: False (not listed in the extractor index).
  - _TEST: Direct MMS link with expected id, ext, and title derived from the URL; skip_download is indicated (since MMSRTSP/RTMP may require external players).
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Derives video_id via _generic_id(url) and title via _generic_title(url).
    - Returns a dict with id, title, and the raw 'url' field (no separate formats list).

Important implementation details:
- Both extractors disable listing in the main extractor index via IE_DESC = False.
- Metadata extraction relies on the inherited _generic_id and _generic_title to derive id/title from the URL.
- RTMP extractor formats the output as a single format with ext 'flv' and uses the URL scheme as format_id (via compat_urlparse.urlparse(url).scheme).
- MMS extractor returns a simple dict with the direct MMS URL (no separate formats list).
- The file imports unicode_literals for compatibility, and uses compat_urlparse for parsing the RTMP URL scheme.

Overall, this module provides lightweight support for RTMP and MMS streams by exposing the given URL(s) with minimal derived metadata, without implementing full streaming negotiation.
