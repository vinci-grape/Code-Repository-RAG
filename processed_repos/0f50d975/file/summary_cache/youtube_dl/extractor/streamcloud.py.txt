Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/streamcloud.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-dl extractor (StreamcloudIE) for the streaming site streamcloud.eu to retrieve a direct video URL and metadata.

- Key class
  - StreamcloudIE(InfoExtractor)
    - IE_NAME: 'streamcloud.eu'
    - _VALID_URL: Matches URLs like http(s)://streamcloud.eu/<id> or http(s)://streamcloud.eu/<id>/<fname>.html
    - _TESTS: Includes tests demonstrating extraction behavior and an EU-only access note (first test is skipped unless EU access is available).

- Main functionality (_real_extract)
  - Extract video_id from the URL using _match_id.
  - Reconstruct a canonical page URL: http://streamcloud.eu/<video_id>.
  - Download the initial page (orig_webpage) to check if the video exists (looks for '>File Not Found<' and raises ExtractorError if missing).
  - Parse form fields from the page:
    - Collect all input elements with type="hidden" or type="submit" and capture name and value attributes.
    - This yields a list of (name, value) pairs to be submitted in a POST request.
  - Sleep for 6 seconds (_sleep(6, video_id)) to bypass basic anti-bot protections.
  - Submit a POST request to the same URL with the encoded form data (urlencode_postdata(fields)) and Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
  - Parse the response (webpage) to extract:
    - title: via an HTML regex looking for the content inside an <h1> tag.
    - video_url: via a regex searching for file: "URL" (the direct video URL).
  - If extraction fails, attempt to provide a friendlier error:
    - Look for a message inside a div with class that includes msgboxinfo.
    - If found, raise ExtractorError with "<IE_NAME> said: <message>".
    - Otherwise re-raise the original error.
  - thumbnail (optional): extract image URL from image: "URL" if present (non-fatal).
  - Return a dict with:
    - id: video_id
    - title: extracted title
    - url: direct video URL
    - thumbnail: optional thumbnail URL
    - http_headers: includes Referer set to the page URL (to satisfy hotlink protection on some streams)

- Important implementation details
  - The extractor relies on a two-step page interaction:
    1) fetch initial page to collect hidden/form fields.
    2) POST those fields to obtain the actual page containing the video URL.
  - Uses a deliberate delay (_sleep) to mimic human interaction and bypass simple anti-bot measures.
  - Robust error handling: if the expected fields/title/video URL arenâ€™t found, it attempts to surface any embedded error message from the page.
  - The returned video request includes a Referer header, which some servers require to authorize the video request.

- Dependencies and helpers
  - Inherits from InfoExtractor.
  - Uses utils ExtractorError and urlencode_postdata for error handling and form submission.
  - Uses helper methods _download_webpage, _html_search_regex, _search_regex, _sleep, and _match_id provided by the base class.
