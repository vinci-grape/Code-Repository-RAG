Summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/commonmistakes.py

Purpose
- Provides two lightweight extractors to help users when they misuse youtube-dl or run into common URL issues.

Key classes
1) CommonMistakesIE (InfoExtractor)
- Purpose: Detects a common user mistake where the URL parameter is literally the strings "url" or "URL" (instead of a real URL) and raises a helpful error.
- Key attributes:
  - IE_DESC = False: This extractor is not listed in help/description.
  - _VALID_URL = matches exactly "url" or "URL" at the end of the string.
  - _TESTS: Two tests that only check matching for "url" and "URL" with only_matching=True.
- Main behavior (_real_extract):
  - Constructs a friendly message stating that downloading the literal URL is nonsensical.
  - If youtube-dl is not run in verbose mode, appends a tip to run with -v to see arguments/config.
  - Raises ExtractorError with the constructed message (marked as expected).
- Implementation notes:
  - Accesses self._downloader.params to check verbose mode.
  - Uses the ExtractorError type from youtube_dl.utils.

2) UnicodeBOMIE (InfoExtractor)
- Purpose: Detects and handles URLs that start with a Byte Order Mark (BOM, U+FEFF).
- Key attributes:
  - IE_DESC = False: Not listed in help/descriptions.
  - _VALID_URL = uses a named group bom to capture the BOM and a named group id for the remainder: (?P<bom>\ufeff)(?P<id>.*)$
  - _TESTS: Enabled for most Python versions except 3.1–3.3 (due to BOM handling issues in that range); test uses a URL starting with the BOM.
- Main behavior (_real_extract):
  - real_url = self._match_id(url): extracts the part after the BOM (the real URL).
  - Calls self.report_warning(...) to inform the user that the URL started with a BOM and that it’s removing it to look for the real URL.
  - Returns self.url_result(real_url) to redirect/continue extraction with the cleaned URL.
- Implementation notes:
  - _match_id(url) relies on the pattern with the BOM group; real_url corresponds to the id group.
  - url_result(...) delegates to the normal extraction flow for the cleaned URL.
  - The BOM warning is informational, not an error.

Important implementation details
- Both extractors set IE_DESC = False to avoid listing them as standard extractors in help output.
- Use of _TESTS with only_matching ensures URL matching tests for these special cases without requiring full extraction logic.
- CommonMistakesIE raises an ExtractorError with a helpful message, signaling a user mistake rather than a real extraction failure.
- UnicodeBOMIE gracefully handles BOM-prefixed URLs by warning the user and re-routing to the cleaned URL instead of failing.
- Python version gating in UnicodeBOMIE tests accounts for known BOM-related issues in early Python 3.x releases (3.1–3.3).

In short, the file provides two targeted extractors:
- One to catch a misused literal "url"/"URL" input and guide the user to correct it.
- One to detect and strip a leading UTF-8 BOM from URLs, warning the user, and continuing extraction with the cleaned URL.
