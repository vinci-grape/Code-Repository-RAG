Concise yet comprehensive summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/yesjapan.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-dl extractor for YesJapan video pages, extracting basic video metadata and a direct video URL for download.

- Key class
  - YesJapanIE(InfoExtractor): Subclass of youtube_dl's InfoExtractor.

- URL matching
  - _VALID_URL: Regex matching URLs like
    http(s)://www.yesjapan.com/video/{slug}_{id}.html
    - Captures slug and id; id is alphanumeric and used as the video id.

- Test data
  - _TEST: Sample URL with expected md5, and info_dict containing:
    - id, title, description, ext (mp4), timestamp, upload_date, thumbnail
  - Useful for automated testing within youtube-dl.

- Core extraction (_real_extract)
  - Extracts video_id via self._match_id(url) from the regex group.
  - Downloads the webpage: self._download_webpage(url, video_id).
  - Metadata extraction using Open Graph helpers:
    - title = self._og_search_title(webpage)
    - video_url = self._og_search_video_url(webpage)
    - description = self._og_search_description(webpage)
    - thumbnail = self._og_search_thumbnail(webpage)
  - Upload timestamp extraction:
    - Looks for an element with class="pm-submit-data" using get_element_by_attribute.
    - If found, extracts datetime attribute via regex r'datetime="([^"]+)"'.
    - Converts to a timestamp using parse_iso8601. If not found, timestamp remains None.
  - Resolve final video URL (to obtain proper extension if redirects occur):
    - Creates a HEAD request (HEADRequest(video_url)).
    - Performs a non-fatal request to resolve redirects: self._request_webpage(..., fatal=False).
    - If a response is obtained, uses req.geturl() as the final video_url.
  - Formats information:
    - formats = [{'format_id': 'sd', 'url': video_url}]
    - This implies a single format entry labeled 'sd' (standard definition).
  - Return dictionary with:
    - id, title, formats, description, timestamp, thumbnail

- Important implementation details
  - Uses Open Graph tags to extract most metadata robustly.
  - Timestamp extraction is optional (fatal=False path); if missing, timestamp stays None.
  - Redirect resolution is non-fatal; if final URL cannot be resolved, the original video_url is used.
  - The extractor provides only one format (sd) based on the final or initial video URL; it does not parse multiple quality variants.
  - The returned info_dict aligns with youtube-dl conventions: id, title, formats, description, timestamp, thumbnail (no duration or uploader fields).

Overall, YesJapanIE fetches page metadata via Open Graph, optionally reads an upload datetime from a specific page element, resolves any redirects to get a stable video URL, and returns a minimal but usable video entry with a single SD format.
