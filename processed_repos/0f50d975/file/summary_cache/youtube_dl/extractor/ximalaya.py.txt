Here is a concise, comprehensive summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/ximalaya.py.

Overview
- Implements two extractors for the Ximalaya (喜马拉雅FM) site:
  - XimalayaIE: extracts individual tracks.
  - XimalayaAlbumIE: extracts albums, yielding each track as a separate XimalayaIE entry.
- Base class XimalayaBaseIE sets a geo-restriction: CN.
- Focus is on main functionality, key classes/functions, and important implementation details (URLs, formats, thumbnails, descriptions, pagination).

Key classes
- XimalayaBaseIE(InfoExtractor)
  - Provides GEO_COUNTRIES = ['CN'].
- XimalayaIE(XimalayaBaseIE)
  - IE_NAME: 'ximalaya'
  - IE_DESC: '喜马拉雅FM'
  - _VALID_URL: matches track page URLs like
    - http(s)://(www.|m.)ximalaya.com/<uid>/sound/<id>
  - _USER_URL_FORMAT: template for uploader URL
  - _TESTS: three tests covering desktop and mobile URLs, with expected info_dict fields (id, ext, uploader, uploader_id, uploader_url, title, description, thumbnails, categories, duration, view_count, like_count)
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Determines if URL is mobile (contains 'm.ximalaya') and selects scheme (http/https).
    - Extracts audio_id from URL, downloads the track page.
    - Downloads track info JSON from scheme://m.ximalaya.com/tracks/<id>.json.
    - Builds formats from play_path_32 (24k) and play_path_64 (64k) if present.
    - Collects thumbnails from all keys starting with 'cover_url' (adds width/height for cover_url_142).
    - uploader_id from audio_info.uid; uploader URL via _USER_URL_FORMAT if present.
    - Title, description (two-site specific regexes for mobile/desktop), with a fallback to a rich_intro file if the description is not found on the page.
    - Categories from category_name or category_title in audio_info.
    - Duration, view_count (play_count), like_count (favorites_count).
    - Returns a dict with id, uploader, uploader_id, uploader_url, title, thumbnails, description, categories, duration, view_count, like_count, and formats.
- XimalayaAlbumIE(XimalayaBaseIE)
  - IE_NAME: 'ximalaya:album'
  - IE_DESC: '喜马拉雅FM 专辑'
  - _VALID_URL: matches album URLs like
    - http(s)://(www.|m.)ximalaya.com/<uid>/album/<id>
  - _TEMPLATE_URL: album page template used to fetch the initial page
  - _BASE_URL_TEMPL: base URL template used to build full URLs
  - _LIST_VIDEO_RE: regex to extract individual track links within an album page
  - _TESTS: tests for an album URL, expecting title and id, and playlist_count
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Determines scheme (http/https).
    - Extracts uid and playlist_id from URL using _VALID_URL.
    - Downloads the album page via the template URL.
    - Extracts album title (if present) and returns a playlist result built from entries and the title.
  - _entries(page, playlist_id, uid):
    - Iterates over pages of the album using a loop (pagination supported).
    - For each page, yields entries from _process_page(html, uid).
    - Detects next page via a rel="next" link; follows and continues until no next link.
  - _process_page(html, uid):
    - Looks for the section containing album_soundlist and uses _LIST_VIDEO_RE to find each track entry.
    - Yields a URL result pointing to the track URL, with track id and title, using XimalayaIE.ie_key() as the extractor.

Important implementation details
- Formats construction: from audio_info JSON, collect play_path_32 (24k) and/or play_path_64 (64k) into a list of formats with format_id ('24k'/'64k') and the corresponding URL.
- Thumbnails extraction: collects all keys starting with 'cover_url', including special handling for 'cover_url_142' by adding width and height (180).
- Description handling:
  - Mobile: attempts to extract from a <section class="content">...</section>.
  - Desktop: attempts to extract from a <div class="rich_intro">...</div>.
  - If not found, falls back to downloading a rich_intro page/file and stripping whitespace.
- Uploader info: uses 'nickname' for uploader name and 'uid' for uploader_id; uploader_url is built from _USER_URL_FORMAT.
- Categories: uses either category_name or category_title from the track JSON, filtering out None.
- Album pagination: _entries iterates through pages by following next links until none remain.
- Album-to-track mapping: entries yield as URL results pointing to XimalayaIE (ie_key()), effectively aggregating individual track extractors into a playlist.
- GEO restriction: only allows extraction within CN, via XimalayaBaseIE.

What this enables
- Downloading individual Ximalaya tracks with full metadata (title, uploader, thumbnails, description, duration, views/likes, and audio formats).
- Downloading Ximalaya albums as playlists, with each track resolved via the track extractor, and proper handling of pagination.

In short, the file provides robust extraction support for both single tracks and albums on Ximalaya, including formats, thumbnails, descriptions, uploader info, categories, and pagination.
