Concise summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/trilulilu.py

Purpose
- Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for Trilulilu.ro to fetch metadata and direct media URLs for videos and audio on trilulilu.ro.

Key class
- TriluliluIE(InfoExtractor)
  - Inherits common extractor behavior from InfoExtractor.

Main functionality
- URL matching
  - Uses _VALID_URL to recognize trilulilu.ro pages and capture a display id (slug) from the URL.
- Data source
  - Retrieves JSON data from the mobile site: http://m.trilulilu.ro/<display_id>?format=json
- Error handling and access control
  - Checks media_info['errors']:
    - friends -> video is private (ExtractorError, expected)
    - geoblock -> not available in country (ExtractorError, expected)
    - xxx_unlogged -> set age_limit to 18
- Media validation
  - Ensures media_class is either 'video' or 'audio'; otherwise raises an error.
- Metadata extraction
  - user information from media_info['user']
  - thumbnail from media_info['cover_url'] (note: code calls thumbnail.format(...) but does not store the result, which is likely a bug)
  - title from media_info['title']
  - description from media_info.get('description')
  - uploader_id from user['username'], uploader from user['fullname']
  - published timestamp parsed via parse_iso8601(media_info.get('published'), ' ')
  - duration, view_count, like_count, comment_count converted to integers with int_or_none
  - age_limit determined from errors as 0 or 18

Formats construction
- Base format
  - url: media_info['href']
  - ext: stream_type (e.g., 'mp4')
- HD format (if available)
  - format_id: 'hd'
  - url: media_info['hrefhd']
  - ext: same as stream_type
- Audio handling
  - If media_class == 'audio', set formats[0]['vcodec'] = 'none' (no video)
  - Else (video), set formats[0]['format_id'] = 'sd'
- Note: The ext for all formats comes from stream_type

Returned information
- id: extracted from media_info['identifier'].split('|')[1]
- display_id: the slug from the URL
- formats: list of one or two format entries (base and optional HD)
- title, description, thumbnail
- uploader_id, uploader
- timestamp (parsed)
- duration, view_count, like_count, comment_count
- age_limit

Tests
- _TESTS contains two sample URLs with expected metadata (md5, info_dict) to validate extraction:
  - Example 1: http://www.trilulilu.ro/big-buck-bunny-1
  - Example 2: http://www.trilulilu.ro/adena-ft-morreti-inocenta
  - Tests validate id, title, description, uploader info, timestamps, and counts.

Implementation notes and potential issues
- thumbnail handling appears incorrect: thumbnail = media_info.get('cover_url'); if thumbnail: thumbnail.format(width='1600', height='1200')
  - thumbnail.format(...) creates a new string but is not assigned back; likely intended to reassign thumbnail or pass new size elsewhere.
- The code assumes certain fields exist (href, hrefhd, stream_type, identifier, etc.) in the JSON structure returned by Trilulilu.
- Extensibility: supports both audio and video with proper handling of vcodec for audio and a default 'sd' format_id for video.

Overall, this extractor fetches a JSON representation of a Trilulilu media item, handles common access errors, builds usable direct media URLs, and returns a rich metadata dictionary suitable for downstream processing by youtube-dl.
