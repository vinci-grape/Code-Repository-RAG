ConciseSummary:

- Purpose
  - Implement two extractors for the vvvvid.it service in youtube-dl: VVVVIDIE (single video) and VVVVIDShowIE (season/show playlist).
  - Supports multiple backends/formats (HLS/M3U8, Akamai, Wowza, YouTube, etc.) and a custom embed obfuscation (ds) used by VVVVID.

- Key classes
  - VVVVIDIE (InfoExtractor)
  - VVVVIDShowIE (inherits VVVVIDIE) for show-level playlists

- URL patterns
  - VVVVIDIE: _VALID_URL_BASE matches vvvvid.itUs show/anime/film/series pages; _VALID_URL extracts show_id, season_id, and video_id from URLs like
    /#!show/<show_id>/.../<season_id>/<video_id> or similar without #!.
  - VVVVIDShowIE: _VALID_URL matches show listing URLs like /show/<id>/title (optional show title).

- Login/connection flow
  - _real_initialize logs in to https://www.vvvvid.it/user/login and stores conn_id from the response.
  - _download_info uses this conn_id to fetch on-demand data from https://www.vvvvid.it/vvvvid/ondemand/<show_id>/<path> with optional query parameters (e.g., video_id).

- Data extraction and flow (VVVVIDIE)
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Parses show_id, season_id, video_id from URL.
    - Fetches season data via _download_info(show_id, 'season/<season_id>', video_id, query={'video_id': video_id}).
    - Locates the specific video_data entry by matching video_id within the response.
    - Builds a list of available formats by decoding embed codes (embed_info) using a custom decryption function ds() (reverse-engineered from vvvvid.js).
    - ds(h) decodes the obfuscated embed strings to actual video URLs; includes a non-trivial alphabet mapping and bitwise reconstruction.
    - For each quality variant ('' and '_sd'), it:
      - Decodes embed_code with ds().
      - video_type handling:
        - video/kenc: transform embed URL, optionally fetch additional key via /kenc, append any ds-encoded message, decode formats via HLS (master.m3u8).
        - video/rcs: Akamai formats.
        - video/youtube: uses a transparent redirect to YouTube (ie_key = YoutubeIE); set _type to url_transparent and break (no local formats).
        - video/dash: HLS-like m3u8 formats.
        - else (default): Wowza-based formats.
      - metadata_from_url(embed_code) to extract episode/season info from the embed URL when possible.
    - If not using YouTube, sorts and assigns the collected formats to info['formats'].
    - Collects metadata:
      - id, title, duration, series, season_id, episode, description, thumbnail, view_count, like_count, repost_count
      - episode_id (as string), episode_number/season_number from URL when available (via metadata_from_url).
    - Returns a complete info dict for the video.

  - _extract_common_video_info(video_data)
    - Returns a small dict with thumbnail and episode_id (string).

  - Helper: ds(h)
    - Implements the deobfuscation algorithm for embed_info; the reverse-engineered function converts the obfuscated string into a usable URL.

- Data sources and fields
  - video_data fields used: title, length, show_title, season_id, video_id, video_type, embed_info, thumbnail, views, video_likes, video_shares, etc.
  - Builds standard YouTube-dl info dict fields: id, title, duration, thumbnail, series, season_id, episode, episode_number, view_count, like_count, repost_count, description, uploader/uploader_id when pulling YouTube data.

- Show extractor (VVVVIDShowIE)
  - _VALID_URL: matches show pages and optional title slug.
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extracts show_id and optional show_title from URL.
    - Retrieves seasons data via _download_info(show_id, 'seasons/', show_title).
    - Retrieves show info via _download_info(show_id, 'info/', show_title, fatal=False).
    - If no show_title, adjusts base_url to include /title.
    - Iterates over seasons and episodes; skips non-playable episodes.
    - For each episode with season_id and video_id, builds an info dict with:
      - _type = url_transparent, ie_key = VVVVIDIE, url = "<base_url>/<season_id>/<video_id>"
      - title, description, season_id, playlist_title
      - Also uses _extract_common_video_info(episode) for thumbnail/episode_id
    - Returns a playlist_result with all episode entries, using show_id as playlist id and show title/description as metadata.

- Tests and behavior
  - _TESTS include examples of multiple video types (video/vvvvid, video/rcs, video/youtube, video/dash) and a mix of metadata expectations (title, id, duration, counts, etc.).
  - Handles errors from the backend by raising ExtractorError with the server-supplied message.
  - Uses geo_verification_headers() for location/geo checks on requests.
  - Uses int_or_none and str_or_none for robust numeric/string typing.

- Important implementation details
  - The extractor logs in to obtain a conn_id and uses it for all subsequent ondemand data requests.
  - Embeds are decoded with a bespoke ds() function, which is a key part of decrypting the embed_info values to real video URLs.
  - Multiple video backends are supported, with a clear branching strategy per video_type.
  - YouTube videos are handled by delegating to YoutubeIE via a url_transparent entry, preserving upstream extraction logic.
  - Show extraction compiles a transparent list of episodes across seasons into a single playlist, each pointing back to VVVVIDIE for actual video extraction.

In short, this file provides a robust VVVVID integration: authenticates to fetch data, decrypts and resolves multiple video formats (including YouTube), handles both single videos and show playlists, and surfaces rich metadata (titles, durations, counts, series/season/episode info).
