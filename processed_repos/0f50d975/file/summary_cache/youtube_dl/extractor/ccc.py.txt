Here is a concise, comprehensive summary of the CCC extractor file:

- Purpose
  - Implements two extractors for CCC.de on YouTube-DL:
    - CCCIE: extracts video/recording formats for a single CCC event.
    - CCCPlaylistIE: collects all events for a CCC conference (playlist) and links them to CCCIE entries.

- CCCIE (single event extractor)
  - Class: CCCIE
  - Identifier and URL:
    - IE_NAME: 'media.ccc.de'
    - _VALID_URL matches https://media.ccc.de/v/<id>
  - Main workflow (_real_extract):
    - Derives display_id from the URL via _match_id and downloads the page.
    - Extracts event_id by regex: data-id='(\d+)' in the page.
    - Fetches full event data from https://media.ccc.de/public/events/<event_id>.
  - Formats construction:
    - Iterates over event_data['recordings']:
      - Skips if recording_url is missing.
      - Builds format_id using language and folder:
        - format_id starts with language if present.
        - If folder is present, append '-' + folder; otherwise use folder as format_id.
      - Determines video codec (vcodec) from folder:
        - 'h264' appears in folder → vcodec = 'h264'
        - folder in ('mp3', 'opus') → vcodec = 'none'
        - else vcodec = None
      - Creates a format dict with:
        - format_id, url, width, height (int_or_none), filesize (int_or_none with invscale=1024*1024 to MB), language, vcodec
    - Calls _sort_formats(formats) to order formats.
  - Returned metadata:
    - id: event_id
    - display_id: display_id
    - title: event_data['title']
    - creator: joined string from event_data['persons'] (via try_get)
    - description: event_data.get('description')
    - thumbnail: event_data.get('thumb_url')
    - timestamp: parse_iso8601(event_data.get('date'))
    - duration: int_or_none(event_data.get('length'))
    - tags: event_data.get('tags')
    - formats: the assembled formats list
  - _TESTS:
    - Includes a concrete example with md5, and an expected info_dict (id, ext, titles, creator, description, thumbnail, upload_date, timestamp, duration, tags).

- CCCPlaylistIE (playlist extractor)
  - Class: CCCPlaylistIE
  - Identifier and URL:
    - IE_NAME: 'media.ccc.de:lists'
    - _VALID_URL matches https://media.ccc.de/c/<id>
  - Main workflow (_real_extract):
    - playlist_id = lowercased _match_id(url)
    - Downloads conference JSON from https://media.ccc.de/public/conferences/<playlist_id>
    - Iterates over conf['events']:
      - Extracts event frontend URL from event data (frontend_link)
      - If present, adds an entry to the playlist using self.url_result(event_url, ie=CCCIE.ie_key()) so each item uses CCCIE
    - Returns a playlist result with:
      - entries (list of URL results to CCCIE)
      - id (playlist_id)
      - title (conf.get('title'))
  - _TESTS:
    - Example playlist test with title '30C3' and id '30c3' and 135 entries.

- Key implementation details
  - Robust data extraction:
    - Uses _download_webpage, _download_json, _search_regex, and _match_id with safe fallbacks.
    - Creator extraction uses try_get to gracefully handle missing fields.
  - Format identification:
    - Combines language and folder into a meaningful format_id, e.g., "en-1080p" or "de".
    - Infers video codec from folder (e.g., h264, audio-only yields vcodec 'none').
  - File size handling:
    - Uses int_or_none with invscale to convert recording['size'] to MB.
  - Timestamps and durations:
    - Uses parse_iso8601 for date fields; int_or_none for 'length'.
  - Playlist composition:
    - Builds a playlist by aggregating event URLs from a conference and linking each via CCCIE, enabling centralized access to all related CCC videos.

- Usage outcomes
  - CCCIE enables downloading CCC.de event videos with multiple formats (video+audio, audio-only, etc.) and rich metadata (title, creator, description, thumbnail, date, duration, tags).
  - CCCPlaylistIE enables aggregating all events of a conference into a single playlist, with each item resolved to CCCIE for actual video extraction.

This summarizes the main functionality, structure, and noteworthy implementation details of the CCC extractor file.
