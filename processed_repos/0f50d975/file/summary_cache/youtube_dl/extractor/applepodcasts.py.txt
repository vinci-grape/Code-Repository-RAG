Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/applepodcasts.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL (yt-dlp compatible) extractor for Apple Podcasts episode pages. It returns a single episode info dictionary with id, title, url, description, timestamp, duration, series, thumbnail, and codec/format data.

- Main class
  - ApplePodcastsIE(InfoExtractor)

- URL matching
  - _VALID_URL: Matches Apple Podcasts episode URLs that contain a query parameter i=<digits> identifying the episode.
  - Supports variations of the path (podcast/[…], etc.) to cover different Apple Podcasts page formats.

- Tests
  - _TESTS contains a primary test for an episode with id 1000482637777, expecting mp3 audio, and fields like title, description, upload_date, timestamp, duration, series, and thumbnail.
  - Includes additional URL patterns with only_matching to ensure URL matching logic is robust.

- Core extraction flow (_real_extract)
  - Derives episode_id from the URL via _match_id and downloads the webpage.
  - Data sources (two page formats) to support different Apple Podcasts page structures:
    1) 2021-11+ AMP data:
       - Looks for JSON blob under id "shoebox-media-api-cache-amp-podcasts".
       - Extracts a nested structure, focusing on an entry where type == 'podcast-episodes' and id matches episode_id.
       - Normalizes to amp_data['d'] and then selects the specific episode data.
    2) Pre-2021-11 Ember data:
       - If AMP data not found, uses "shoebox-ember-data-store" JSON.
       - Tries to fetch episode data via ember_data[episode_id]['data'] or ember_data.
  - Episode data extraction:
    - episode = episode_data['attributes']
    - description = episode.get('description') or {}
  - Series name resolution:
    - First, attempt to locate a related 'media/podcast' item in the included data (amp_data or ember_data['included']) and read its attributes['name'].
    - If not found, fall back to the HTML element with class 'podcast-header__identity' and clean the text.
  - Info dictionary construction:
    - id: episode_id
    - title: episode['name']
    - url: clean_podcast_url(episode['assetUrl'])
    - description: description.get('standard') or description.get('short')
    - timestamp: parse_iso8601(episode.get('releaseDateTime'))
    - duration: int_or_none(episode.get('durationInMilliseconds'), 1000)
    - series: resolved series name
    - thumbnail: self._og_search_thumbnail(webpage)
  - Post-processing:
    - _sort_formats(info) is called, then info is reduced to the first (and expected only) item.
    - codecs are determined via parse_codecs(info.get('ext', 'mp3')) and merged into the info dict.
  - Returns the final info dict containing all extracted fields plus codec information for proper format handling.

- Important implementation details
  - Robust handling of two data schemas (AMP-based and Ember-based) to support different Apple Podcasts page structures.
  - Uses try_get to safely navigate potentially missing nested data.
  - Uses next with a generator to locate the correct included entry for the series name.
  - Fallback to HTML parsing for the series name if JSON data doesn’t contain it.
  - Cleaned URL and description fields via helper utilities (clean_podcast_url, clean_html).
  - Timestamp and duration conversions handled with parse_iso8601 and int_or_none (with 1000 as the multiplier for milliseconds).
  - Codec/extension handling via parse_codecs to populate appropriate fields (e.g., ext, vcodec, acodec).

Overall, this extractor fetches and reconciles Apple Podcasts episode data from either AMP or Ember data structures, derives metadata (including series name with a fallback to HTML), computes the correct audio URL, and returns a complete, codec-aware info dictionary suitable for download.
