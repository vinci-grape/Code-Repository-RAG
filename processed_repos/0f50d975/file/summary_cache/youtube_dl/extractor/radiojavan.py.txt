Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/radiojavan.py

Purpose
- Implement an InfoExtractor (RadioJavanIE) for extracting video information from radiojavan.com video pages.

Key components
- Class RadioJavanIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: RegEx pattern identifying RadioJavan video URLs: http(s)://(www.)?radiojavan.com/videos/video/{id}
  - _TEST: Sample test data including URL, expected MP4 extension, title, thumbnail, upload date, and counts.

Main workflow (_real_extract)
1) Identify video_id
   - Extracts the id portion from the URL using self._match_id(url).

2) Retrieve video host
   - Performs a POST request to https://www.radiojavan.com/videos/video_host with form data {'id': video_id} using self._download_json.
   - Includes headers: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded and Referer set to the original URL.
   - Response expected to provide a 'host' value. If missing, defaults to 'https://host1.rjmusicmedia.com'.

3) Download page HTML
   - Fetches the full HTML of the video page via self._download_webpage(url, video_id).

4) Parse available video formats
   - Scans the webpage for JavaScript variable declarations of the form RJ.video<format_id> = '<url>'.
     - Regex used: RJ\.video(?P<format_id>\d+[pPkK])\s*=\s*(["\'])(?P<url>(?:(?!\2).)+)\2
     - Extracted format_id examples: 720p, 1080P, etc.
   - For each match:
     - Resolves the actual video URL by urljoin(download_host, video_path).
     - Converts format_id into a standard format via parse_resolution(format_id).
     - Updates the format dict with 'url' and 'format_id'.
   - Collects all formats and sorts them with self._sort_formats(formats).

5) Metadata extraction
   - Title: self._og_search_title(webpage) using OpenGraph meta tags.
   - Thumbnail: self._og_search_thumbnail(webpage) using OpenGraph meta tag.
   - Upload date: Extracted via regex on the page:
     - Regex: class="date_added">Date added: ([^<]+)<
     - Converted to standardized date with unified_strdate; non-fatal if missing.
   - View/like/dislike counts: Extracted via regexes and converted to integers with str_to_int; all are non-fatal if missing.
     - View count: class="views">Plays: ([\d,]+)
     - Like count: class="rating">([\d,]+) likes
     - Dislike count: class="rating">([\d,]+) dislikes

6) Return
   - Constructs and returns a dictionary with:
     - id: video_id
     - title: title
     - thumbnail: thumbnail
     - upload_date: upload_date
     - view_count: view_count
     - like_count: like_count
     - dislike_count: dislike_count
     - formats: list of parsed formats

Implementation details and nuances
- Uses a two-step approach: first obtain a host for video segments, then parse segments from the page.
- The host retrieval uses a POST request with application/x-www-form-urlencoded data and Referer header for compatibility with the remote endpoint.
- Video formats are embedded in the page as JavaScript variables (RJ.video...); parsing relies on a robust regex that captures both the format id and the URL literal (handling either single or double quotes).
- The code gracefully handles missing metadata (upload date and counts) by using fatal=False in searches.
- Default host fallback ensures the extractor can still build full URLs if the host value is not present in the JSON response.

Overall, this extractor fetches a host for video segments, parses available video formats from the page’s JavaScript, and gathers metadata (title, thumbnail, upload date, and counts) to output a structured video info dictionary compatible with youtube-dl’s downstream processing.
