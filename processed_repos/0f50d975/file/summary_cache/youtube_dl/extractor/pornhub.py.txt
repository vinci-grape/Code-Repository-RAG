Concise yet comprehensive summary of the file

What this file does
- Implements the PornHub (and Thumbzilla) extractor suite for youtube-dl.
- Supports single videos, user/channel/pornstar pages, and paginated video lists across multiple hosts (pornhub.com/net/org, premium, onion, etc.).
- Handles login (including separate accounts for pornhub and pornhubpremium) via netrc, age-gate cookies, geo-restrictions, and content behind dynamic/JS-rendered pages.
- Extracts video formats from multiple sources (flashvars, JS-defined format lists, mpd, and m3u8), subtitles, metadata, and tags/categories.
- Provides robust playlist and paginated video-list extraction with fallback strategies when some pages are not accessible via certain URLs.

Key classes and their roles
- PornHubBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Core shared logic for PornHub sites.
  - Handles dynamic JS content with PhantomJSwrapper: _download_webpage_handle is overridden to detect certain indicators and fetch the page via a headless JS runner if needed.
  - _real_initialize initializes login state (_logged_in).
  - _login(host): performs login for both pornhub and pornhubpremium, using credentials from netrc machines (split by host). Sets cookies (age_verified) and uses front/authenticate for login. Raises ExtractorError with helpful messages on failure.
  - _extract_urls(webpage): helper to pull embed URLs from iframes that point to PornHub embed pages.
  - Utility helpers: _extract_count to parse numeric counts, and various metadata extraction helpers used by concrete extractors.

- PornHubIE (single video extractor)
  - Inherits from PornHubBaseIE.
  - _VALID_URL matches various porn hub hosts and video/embed paths.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Logs in and sets age-verification cookie.
    - Loads the video page (with platform cookie).
    - Detects and surfaces error messages (video removed, user messages) or geo-blocks.
    - Determines title (tries twitter:title meta first, then multiple HTML fallbacks).
    - Extracts video sources:
      - Parses flashvars JSON embedded on the page; may yield subtitles (closedCaptionsFile), thumbnail, duration, mediaDefinitions (multiple quality definitions).
      - If flashvars exist, builds a list of (video_url, height) from mediaDefinitions.
      - If not, uses encoded JS vars (var FORMAT_*.), with a helper extract_js_vars to interpret basic JS value expressions including string concatenation and var references.
      - Handles special /video/get_media endpoints that return a medias array with videoUrl and quality.
      - Falls back to other links found on the page (downloadBtn anchors) to collect more video URLs.
    - Upload date: parsed from video URL path if available.
    - Formats: builds a formats list; supports mpd (dash) via _extract_mpd_formats, m3u8 (HLS) via _extract_m3u8_formats, and direct URLs (with inferred height).
    - Sorts formats by height/width/fps/format_id for sensible ordering.
    - Uploader: parsed from the page.
    - Counts: view/like/dislike/comment counts extracted via _extract_count and regexes.
    - Tags and categories: extracted from HTML blocks.
    - Subtitles: populated if found.
    - Uses _search_json_ld to pull additional info and merges it with manually collected fields.
  - Returns a dictionary containing id, title, uploader, upload_date, duration, thumbnail, view/like/dislike/comment counts, formats, age_limit, tags, categories, and subtitles.

- PornHubPlaylistBaseIE (base for playlists)
  - Inherits from PornHubBaseIE.
  - _extract_page(url): parses a numeric page parameter from a URL.
  - _extract_entries(webpage, host): extracts video entries from a container div (skips drop-down menus that use a similar pattern). Yields url_result entries pointing to PornHubIE with video titles for each video found.

- PornHubUserIE
  - Inherits from PornHubPlaylistBaseIE.
  - _VALID_URL matches user/channel/pornstar model pages.
  - _real_extract(url): resolves the user’s videos page and punts to a paginated video list by returning a URL result that points to PornHubPagedVideoListIE with the user’s id as the video_id.

- PornHubPagedPlaylistBaseIE
  - Base for paged video lists (datasets across pages).
  - _has_more(webpage): detects if there are more pages via page_next, rel="next", or moreDataBtn.
  - _entries(url, host, item_id): paginates through pages, with a fallback mechanism:
    - download_page(base_url, page_num)
    - If a 404 occurs on the first page and the URL contains /videos, fallback to a version of the URL without /videos to try main pagination.
    - Breaks when no entries found or no more pages.
  - _real_extract(url): uses _entries() to create a playlist result for the given item_id.

- PornHubPagedVideoListIE
  - Inherits PornHubPagedPlaylistBaseIE.
  - _VALID_URL: matches a broad set of endpoints for video listings (models, users, channels, categories, search, etc.)
  - _TESTS: extensive test cases covering various endpoints, including premium/onion URLs, non-ASCII titles, paid videos, geoblocked content, and multiple listing orders.
  - suitable(cls, url): ensures this extractor is selected only when PornHubIE, PornHubUserIE, or PornHubUserVideosUploadIE are not suitable; acts as a gatekeeper to avoid conflicts with other extractors.

- PornHubUserVideosUploadIE
  - Inherits PornHubPagedPlaylistBaseIE.
  - _VALID_URL: matches user/channel/model/pornstar upload pages containing /videos/upload.
  - _TESTS: samples for upload pages.

Important implementation details and nuances
- Dynamic content handling: _download_webpage_handle in PornHubBaseIE detects pages that load additional content via JavaScript (onload go(), RNKEY cookies, or document.location.reload) and uses PhantomJSwrapper to render/fetch the page as a headless browser before continuing extraction.
- Multi-host login: A single extractor supports both pornhub.com and pornhubpremium.com by deriving the site portion from the host, using separate netrc entries for each, and performing login accordingly. After login, cookies are set to permit access to age-restricted or premium content.
- Comprehensive video URL extraction:
  - Flashvars-based: primary route for video URLs, subtitles, image thumbnail, duration, and mediaDefinitions (which often contain multiple quality levels).
  - JavaScript-encoded format definitions: parse simple JS assignments that may concatenate strings and reference other vars; convert these into actual URLs and, when possible, heights (quality).
  - /video/get_media: resolves a list of media items with videoUrl and quality.
  - Multiple formats: mpd (dash) and m3u8 (HLS) are supported via dedicated extractors; direct URLs are added with inferred height when possible.
  - Fallbacks: additional URLs gathered from downloadBtn anchors, and a mediastring fallback from a medias string JS variable extracted from a loaded page.
- Subtitles: supports en subtitles when a closedCaptionsFile URL is provided in flashvars.
- Metadata extraction:
  - Title: primarily from twitter:title meta; several HTML fallbacks if necessary.
  - Uploader: parsed from specific HTML blocks.
  - Upload date: parsed from video URLs or flashvars when available.
  - Counts: view/like/dislike/comment counts obtained via targeted regexes.
  - Tags and categories: extracted from structured blocks on the page.
  - Description: sourced from JSON-LD but explicitly ignored in some paths (set to None for the final result in this extractor).
- Error handling and restrictions:
  - Clear messages for removed/blocked videos and videos flagged for verification.
  - Geo-restriction handling via raise_geo_restricted when country-blocked indicators are found.
- On-page structure considerations:
  - _extract_entries focuses on a main container to avoid collecting extraneous items from dropdowns that resemble video items.
  - Pagination logic in PornHubPagedPlaylistBaseIE includes a fallback to main pagination if the /videos path is not available for some lists (a known edge case described in code comments).

Tests and coverage
- The file includes a comprehensive set of _TESTS for single videos, non-ASCII titles, subtitles, private/removed videos, geolocation restrictions, onion sites, and numerous listing endpoints (models, users, channels, categories, search, playlists).
- Tests cover both standard and edge-case URLs, including premium and onion variants.

In short
This module provides a full-featured PornHub extractor suite for youtube-dl, with robust handling of dynamic JS content, login flows across multiple hosts, diverse video source formats, subtitles, metadata, and complex pagination across many URL patterns. It includes careful geo-block handling and fallback strategies to maximize the number of successfully extracted videos across the site family.
