Overview:
- This is a youtube-dl extractor for moviezine.se video pages. It defines how to locate a video, fetch metadata, and build a downloadable format list.

Key components:
- Class: MoviezineIE (inherits from InfoExtractor)
- URL pattern: _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?moviezine\.se/video/(?P<id>[^?#]+)'
  - Extracts video_id from the URL path after /video/

- Test data: _TEST provides a sample URL and the expected extracted fields (id, ext, title, description, thumbnail).

Main extraction flow (_real_extract):
1) Parse video_id from URL using the _VALID_URL regex.
2) Download the video page HTML: self._download_webpage(url, video_id)
3) Download the Moviezine API JS player file:
   - URL: http://www.moviezine.se/api/player.js?video=<video_id>
   - Identifier for the download: video_id
   - Description for the download: 'Downloading js api player'
4) Build formats list (only one format is produced here):
   - format_id: 'sd'
   - url: extracted from the JS player content using _html_search_regex on the pattern file: "(.+?)",
   - ext: 'mp4'
   - quality: 0
5) Sort formats with self._sort_formats(formats)
6) Return the info dictionary:
   - id: video_id
   - title: extracted from the JS player via _search_regex on title: "(.+?)",
   - thumbnail: extracted from the JS player via _search_regex on image: "(.+?)",
   - formats: the formats list created above
   - description: extracted from the page via self._og_search_description(webpage)

Implementation details:
- The code relies on regex extraction from the JS API player response rather than parsing the HTML.
- It assumes the JS file exposes:
  - file: "<video_url>"
  - title: "<title>"
  - image: "<thumbnail_url>"
- Only a single SD MP4 format is supported in this extractor (no multiple quality levels).
- Description is pulled from OpenGraph tags on the main webpage (not from the JS), ensuring a fallback if the JS doesn’t provide a description.

Potential caveats:
- If Moviezine changes the structure of api/player.js (e.g., different field names or nesting), the regexes may fail.
- If there are multiple formats in the JS, this extractor currently only collects one (sd).

Overall purpose:
- To enable youtube-dl to download Moviezine.se videos by parsing a simple API JS response to obtain the video URL and related metadata (title and thumbnail), while deriving the description from the page’s OpenGraph data.
