Concise summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/odatv.py

What it does:
- Implements an extraction class for OdaTV video pages, enabling youtube-dl to fetch video URLs and metadata from OdaTV.

Key components:
- Class OdaTVIE(InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Regex that matches OdaTV video pages for both desktop (mob/vid_video.php) URLs and captures the video id as group "id".
  - _TESTS: Contains three tests:
    - A standard desktop URL with expected video id, MD5, and info dict (id, ext mp4, title).
    - A mobile URL (mob_video.php) marked as only_matching.
    - A mobile URL with no video (also only_matching).

Main extraction flow (_real_extract):
- video_id = self._match_id(url):
  - Extracts the id from the URL using the _VALID_URL pattern.
- webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id):
  - Downloads the page HTML for parsing.
- no_video = 'NO VIDEO!' in webpage:
  - Detects a “no video” condition by checking for the literal string NO VIDEO! in the page.
- video_url = self._search_regex(..., default=None if no_video else NO_DEFAULT, group='url'):
  - Attempts to extract the MP4 URL from the page using a regex that looks for a pattern like mp4: "http...".
  - If a video is present (not no_video), raising NO_DEFAULT on failure will propagate as an extraction failure.
  - If no video is detected (no_video), the search returns None (due to default=None).
- if no_video:
  - Raises ExtractorError('Video %s does not exist' % video_id, expected=True):
    - Signals a non-existent video in a user-visible, non-fatal way to the extractor framework.
- Return value (dict) with:
  - id: video_id
  - url: video_url (the direct MP4 URL found)
  - title: remove_start(self._og_search_title(webpage), 'Video: '):
    - Fetches the OpenGraph title from the page and strips a leading 'Video: ' prefix if present.
  - thumbnail: self._og_search_thumbnail(webpage):
    - Fetches the OpenGraph thumbnail URL from the page.

Implementation details:
- Uses standard InfoExtractor utilities:
  - _og_search_title and _og_search_thumbnail to obtain title and thumbnail from OpenGraph metadata.
  - remove_start to clean up the title.
  - _search_regex for extracting the video URL with a dedicated group name 'url'.
  - NO_DEFAULT to indicate that the regex should fail if a video is expected; otherwise None is allowed when no video is present.
- Behavior distinguishes between existing videos and no-video cases:
  - If the page explicitly indicates no video via the NO VIDEO! marker, an ExtractorError is raised with expected=True to reflect a non-recoverable, user-visible error for missing content.
  - If a video is present, the extractor returns a standard info dict with id, direct video URL, title, and thumbnail.

Overall purpose:
- Provide a concise extractor for OdaTV video pages to obtain the direct MP4 URL along with metadata (title and thumbnail) while gracefully handling missing videos.
