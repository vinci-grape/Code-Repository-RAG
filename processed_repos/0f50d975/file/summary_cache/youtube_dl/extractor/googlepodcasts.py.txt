Concise yet comprehensive summary of youtube-dl extractor file: youtube_dl/extractor/googlepodcasts.py

Overview
- Implements Google Podcasts extractors for youtube-dl.
- Provides a common base class plus two specific extractors:
  - GooglePodcastsIE: extracts a single episode.
  - GooglePodcastsFeedIE: extracts a feed (playlist) of episodes.
- Interacts with Google Podcasts internal batchexecute API to fetch episode/feed data.
- Maps Google’s nested data structures into standard youtube-dl info dictionaries.

Key classes and main functionality
- GooglePodcastsBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - _VALID_URL_BASE: Base URL pattern for Google Podcasts feeds: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/
  - _batch_execute(func_id, video_id, params):
    - Calls Google’s internal endpoint https://podcasts.google.com/_/PodcastsUi/data/batchexecute.
    - Sends a POST payload built with urlencode_postdata and an f.req structure containing func_id and params.
    - Uses transform_source with a regex to extract a JSON array from the response, then returns the parsed JSON’s first element’s third item: [0][2].
    - The video_id parameter is passed to _download_json for error context.
  - _extract_episode(episode):
    - Converts a Google episode data object (list/array) into a standard info dict with fields:
      - id: episode[4][3]
      - title: episode[8]
      - url: clean_podcast_url(episode[13])
      - thumbnail: episode[2]
      - description: episode[9]
      - creator: try_get(episode, lambda x: x[14])
      - timestamp: int_or_none(episode[11])
      - duration: int_or_none(episode[12])
      - series: episode[1]

- GooglePodcastsIE (single episode extractor)
  - IE_NAME: 'google:podcasts'
  - _VALID_URL: Extends base with pattern for a specific episode: /feed/.../episode/<id>
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts b64_feed_url and b64_guid from the URL via regex groups.
    - Calls _batch_execute with func_id 'oNjqVe' and params [b64_feed_url, b64_guid].
    - Selects the episode data as [1] from the response, then delegates to _extract_episode to produce the final info dict.

- GooglePodcastsFeedIE (feed/playlist extractor)
  - IE_NAME: 'google:podcasts:feed'
  - _VALID_URL: Extends base with pattern for a feed ID: /feed/<id>/
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts b64_feed_url from the URL.
    - Calls _batch_execute with func_id 'ncqJEe' and params [b64_feed_url].
    - Builds a list of entries by iterating over data[1][0] (safely via try_get) and applying _extract_episode to each episode.
    - Retrieves feed/playlist metadata from data[3], where:
      - title: data[3][0]
      - description: data[3][2]
    - Returns a playlist_result with:
      - entries (list of episode info dicts)
      - playlist_title (from feed)
      - playlist_description (from feed)

Implementation details and notable behavior
- Data sourcing:
  - Uses Google’s internal batchexecute API to fetch both individual episodes and feed contents.
  - The request payload is constructed as a nested JSON array in the f.req field: [[[func_id, json.dumps(params), None, '1']]].
  - The response is wrapped; a transform_source with a regex extracts the actual JSON array portion: r'(?s)(\[.+\])'.
- Data mapping:
  - _extract_episode relies on specific indices in the Google-provided episode structure (e.g., episode[4][3], episode[8], episode[13], etc.). This is tailored mapping from Google’s internal data format to youtube-dl’s standard info dictionary keys.
- Utilities used:
  - clean_podcast_url: normalizes/cleans URLs found in episode data.
  - int_or_none: safely converts numeric fields to int or returns None.
  - try_get: safely accesses nested data without raising exceptions if keys/indices are missing.
  - urlencode_postdata: encodes POST data for the batchexecute request.
- URL patterns and tests:
  - Base URL pattern and two specific extractors extend it to handle:
    - A single episode URL (GooglePodcastsIE).
    - A feed URL listing multiple episodes (GooglePodcastsFeedIE).
  - _TEST sections provide sample URLs and expected info_dict fields (e.g., id, ext, title, description, upload_date, timestamp, duration, series) for validation.
- Python compatibility:
  - Uses __future__ unicode_literals and a straightforward Python 2/3 compatible style (as per youtube-dl’s common codebase).

Summary of flow
- For a single episode: parse URL to obtain encoded feed and GUID, fetch episode data via batchexecute, map to a standard info dict.
- For a feed: parse URL to obtain encoded feed, fetch list of episodes via batchexecute, map each to a standard info dict, assemble a playlist with title/description from feed metadata.

In short, this file provides a pair of extractors for Google Podcasts that leverage Google's internal batchexecute API to fetch episode or feed data, then translate Google’s internal data structures into youtube-dl’s conventional information dictionaries.
