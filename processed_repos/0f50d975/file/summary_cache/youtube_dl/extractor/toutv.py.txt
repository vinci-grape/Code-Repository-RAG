Below is a concise, focused summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/toutv.py.

High-level purpose
- Implements a YouTube-DL extractor for Tou TV (Radio-Canada) videos by extending the RadioCanadaIE base extractor.
- Retrieves video metadata from TouTV’s API, handles optional user login to access protected content, and constructs a standard YouTube-DL info dictionary including streaming formats via the parent logic.

Key classes and constants
- TouTvIE (class)
  - Inherits from RadioCanadaIE, reusing common Radio-Canada extraction utilities.
  - _NETRC_MACHINE = 'toutv' (credentials store name)
  - IE_NAME = 'tou.tv'
  - _VALID_URL = regex matching TouTV video pages and capturing an id/path segment
  - _CLIENT_KEY: a client identifier used when calling TouTV Radio-Canada APIs

-_TESTS
- Provides sample URLs and expected extracted information to verify behavior, including:
  - A typical episode page with expected id, title, description, and upload_date, and an instruction to skip download (m3u8).
  - Two other URLs that should only be matched (only_matching).

Key methods

1) _real_initialize(self)
- Optional login flow:
  - Reads login credentials via self._get_login_info().
  - If credentials are provided, performs a login request to:
    https://services.radio-canada.ca/toutv/profiling/accounts/login
  - Request payload includes:
    - ClientId (self._CLIENT_KEY)
    - ClientSecret (static UUID)
    - Email, Password (from user)
    - Scope
  - Request headers include:
    - Authorization: 'client-key ' + self._CLIENT_KEY
    - Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
  - On success, stores the access token in self._access_token (from the response's access_token field).
  - If a 401 error occurs, extracts the error message from the response and raises an ExtractorError with that message (friendly error for bad credentials).
  - After login (whether or not login was attempted), fetches user claims via self._call_api('validation/v2/getClaims') and stores them in self._claims.
- Overall, this enables access to protected content when valid credentials are provided.

2) _real_extract(self, url)
- Extracts the TouTV video id/path with self._match_id(url).
- Retrieves metadata from:
  https://services.radio-canada.ca/toutv/presentation/{path}
  with query parameters:
  - client_key: self._CLIENT_KEY
  - device: 'web'
  - version: 4
- DRM handling:
  - If metadata.get('IsDrm') is truthy, issues a warning that the video is probably DRM protected (noting a known nuance that IsDrm does not always imply DRM protection per a linked issue).
- Core data extraction:
  - video_id = metadata['IdMedia']
  - details = metadata['Details']
  - Builds a base info dict with fields:
    - id: video_id
    - title: details.get('OriginalTitle')
    - description: details.get('Description')
    - thumbnail: details.get('ImageUrl')
    - duration: int_or_none(details.get('LengthInSeconds'))
    - series: metadata.get('ProgramTitle')
    - season_number: int_or_none(metadata.get('SeasonNumber'))
    - season: metadata.get('SeasonTitle')
    - episode_number: int_or_none(metadata.get('EpisodeNumber'))
    - episode: metadata.get('EpisodeTitle')
  - Merges this base dict with the result of:
    self._extract_info(metadata.get('AppCode', 'toutv'), video_id)
    (where _extract_info is provided by the parent class and returns additional information such as streaming formats/urls based on app code and video id)
- Returns the merged dictionary as the final info dict for Youtube-DL.

Important implementation details
- The extractor relies on the RadioCanadaIE infrastructure for common helpers:
  - _download_json for API calls
  - _call_api for authenticated API access
  - _extract_info for building streaming formats from AppCode and video id
  - _parse_json, report_warning, int_or_none, and merge_dicts utilities
- The login flow uses a hard-coded ClientSecret and a specific ClientId (CLIENT_KEY). If login succeeds, an access token is stored for subsequent authenticated requests.
- The final metadata includes both high-level episode information (title, description, duration, series/season/episode) and streaming-related data derived from AppCode via _extract_info.
- The code gracefully handles non-logged-in scenarios (no credentials) by skipping the login step and proceeding with public data retrieval.
- The _VALID_URL indicates the extractor targets TouTV URLs like http(s)://ici.tou.tv/{path}, where path may include season/episode structure such as S2015E17.
- The _TESTS include a 404/Not Found skip scenario for one URL and ensure only_matching is respected for non-video pages.

In summary
- This file implements a TouTV video extractor that:
  - Optionally authenticates with user credentials to access protected content
  - Fetches and parses detailed metadata from TouTV’s presentation API
  - Warns on potentially DRM-protected content
  - Builds a comprehensive info dict with basic metadata plus streaming information supplied by the parent class
  - Uses a consistent client_key-based API flow and handles errors gracefully.
