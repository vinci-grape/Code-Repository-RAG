Here is a concise but comprehensive summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/minds.py.

Purpose
- Implement a set of extractors for Minds.com within youtube-dl:
  - MindsIE: extract individual video/media pages (including activity-based entries and direct videos)
  - MindsChannelIE: extract a channel feed (list of videos) as a playlist
  - MindsGroupIE: extract a group feed (list of videos) as a playlist

Main classes and structure
- MindsBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Shared utilities for Minds.com
  - _VALID_URL_BASE = https?://(www.)?minds.com/
  - _call_api(path, video_id, resource, query=None)
    - Builds API URL: https://www.minds.com/api/{path}
    - Retrieves XSRF token from cookies and passes it as X-XSRF-TOKEN header
    - Uses _download_json to fetch JSON, with Referer header set to https://www.minds.com/

- MindsIE (inherits MindsBaseIE)
  - IE_NAME = 'minds'
  - _VALID_URL matches Minds media pages:
    https://www.minds.com/media/<id>
    https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/<id>
    https://www.minds.com/archive/view/<id>
  - _TESTS: multiple sample URLs with expected metadata (title, uploader, timestamps, counts, tags, etc.)
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Determine entity_id from URL
    - Fetch entity data via API v1/entities/entity/{entity_id}
    - If entity is type 'activity':
      - If custom_type == 'video', use video_id = entity_guid
      - Else, return a direct URL to perma_url (redirect)
    - Else (video), ensure subtype is 'video' and set video_id = entity_id
    - Fetch video data via API v2/media/video/{video_id}
    - Build formats from video.sources:
      - Each source with 'src' becomes a format with format_id (label), height (size), and url
    - Sort formats
    - Choose entity context (video.get('entity') or original entity)
    - Gather uploader information from entity.ownerObj or empty
    - Normalize tags, handling both list and single string cases
    - Resolve thumbnail via poster (video.poster or entity.thumbnail_src) by fetching the URL to ensure validity
    - Return a dict with:
      - id, title, formats, description, license, timestamp
      - uploader, uploader_id, uploader_url
      - view_count, like_count, dislike_count, tags, comment_count
      - thumbnail

- MindsFeedBaseIE (inherits MindsBaseIE)
  - Shared feed logic for channel and group
  - _PAGE_SIZE = 150
  - _entries(feed_id)
    - Iterates through paginated feed videos using v2/feeds/container/{feed_id}/videos
    - Each entry yields a playlist item pointing to MindsIE with the video URL
    - Uses load-next value as new from_timestamp to paginate
    - Stops when fewer than full page or missing next timestamp
  - _real_extract(url)
    - Extract feed_id from URL
    - Fetch feed data via API v1/{self._FEED_PATH}/{feed_id} returning a dict keyed by self._FEED_TYPE
    - Return a playlist_result built from:
      - self._entries(feed['guid']) as the entries
      - feed_id as id
      - strip_or_none(feed.get('name')) as title
      - feed.get('briefdescription') as description

- MindsChannelIE (inherits MindsFeedBaseIE)
  - _FEED_TYPE = 'channel'
  - IE_NAME = 'minds:' + _FEED_TYPE
  - _VALID_URL excludes some paths (newsfeed, media, api, archive, groups) and captures id
  - _FEED_PATH = 'channel'
  - _TEST: sample channel with id and basic info

- MindsGroupIE (inherits MindsFeedBaseIE)
  - _FEED_TYPE = 'group'
  - IE_NAME = 'minds:' + _FEED_TYPE
  - _VALID_URL matches groups/profile/<id>/feed/videos
  - _FEED_PATH = 'groups/group'
  - _TEST: sample group with id and basic info

Key implementation details
- API interaction
  - All data retrieval goes through _call_api, which hits Minds’ API endpoints under https://www.minds.com/api/
  - CSRF protection: token from cookies is sent via X-XSRF-TOKEN header
  - For activity entries, non-video activities route to their perma_url; video activities extract the embedded video
- Video formats
  - Formats are built from video.sources, using:
    - 'src' as URL
    - 'label' as format_id
    - 'size' as height (if provided)
  - Formats are sorted with _sort_formats
- Metadata extraction
  - Title falls back to video_id if missing
  - Description sanitized via clean_html
  - License via str_or_none
  - Timestamps via int_or_none
  - Uploader name and ID extracted from ownerObj
  - Uploader URL constructed if uploader_id is present
  - View/like/dislike/comment counts extracted with int_or_none
  - Tags normalization to always be a list
- Thumbnails
  - Poster URL resolution: video.poster or entity.thumbnail_src
  - Validated by performing a lightweight page request with fatal=False; if retrievable, used as thumbnail URL
- Feeds
  - Channel and Group feeds are implemented via MindsFeedBaseIE
  - Pagination uses limit and sync parameters; continues while there are more pages (load-next provided and full-page results)
  - Entries are emitted as URLs pointing back to MindsIE (video pages) for each video GUID found in the feed
- Tests
  - MindsIE _TESTS cover:
    - Direct video page extraction with expected fields
    - Activity-type entities and fallback to perma_url
    - Non-matching URLs and perma-URL cases
  - MindsChannelIE and MindsGroupIE _TEST entries verify playlist extraction and basic metadata

Overall, the file provides a cohesive implementation for Minds.com inside youtube-dl, handling both individual video extraction (with robust handling of Minds’ entity structure) and channel/group feeds as playlists, with careful attention to formats, metadata normalization, and CSRF-protected API access.
