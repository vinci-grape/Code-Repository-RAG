Summary of code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/teachertube.py

Overview
- Implements two YouTube-DL extractors for Teachertube:
  - TeacherTubeIE: extracts individual video/audio details from teachertube.com video pages.
  - TeacherTubeUserIE: builds a playlist of videos for a user profile or collection page.
- Focuses on identifying media URLs in the page, constructing formats with appropriate quality, and returning metadata (title, description, thumbnail).

Key classes and main functionality
- TeacherTubeIE (InfoExtractor)
  - IE_NAME: 'teachertube'; IE_DESC: 'teachertube.com videos'
  - _VALID_URL: matches various teacherTube video URLs (viewVideo.php?video_id=, music.php?music_id=, video/..., audio/ with numeric id)
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts video_id with _match_id and downloads the page.
    - Checks for error messages in HTML and raises ExtractorError if found.
    - Extracts title from meta tags, stripping trailing ' - TeacherTube' suffix if present.
    - Extracts description from meta tag if available.
    - Sets up quality handling for mp3, flv, mp4 via qualities(['mp3','flv','mp4']).
    - Collects media URLs from page using multiple patterns:
      - data-contenturl="..."
      - var filePath = "..."
      - 'file': '...' in JSON-like structures
    - Builds formats as a list of dicts with 'url' and 'quality', deduplicating with set(media_urls) to avoid duplicates, and using determine_ext(media_url) for quality ranking.
    - Sorts formats with _sort_formats.
    - Determines thumbnail via OpenGraph or meta tag.
    - Returns a dict with id, title, description, thumbnail, and formats.
  - Important notes:
    - Handles multiple video players (flowplayer, jwplayer) implicitly by parsing all possible media URL patterns.
    - Robust to missing fields using default handling (e.g., thumbnail fallback).

- TeacherTubeUserIE (InfoExtractor)
  - IE_NAME: 'teachertube:user:collection'; IE_DESC: 'teachertube.com user and collection videos'
  - _VALID_URL: matches user profile or collection paths with a user id
  - _MEDIA_RE: a compiled, verbose regex to capture video/audio URLs from a page, targeting sidebar thumbnail entries linking to /video/ or /audio/ pages
  - _TEST: sample user URL with playlist_mincount hint
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts user_id from URL using _VALID_URL.
    - Downloads initial user page, collects video/audio URLs via _MEDIA_RE.
    - Finds additional pages via AJAX endpoint /ajax-user/user-videos/{user_id}?page=N, collects pages’ URLs except the last (slicing [:-1]), then iterates:
      - Downloads each page and extends the list of video URLs via _MEDIA_RE.
    - Builds a list of entries using self.url_result(vurl, 'TeacherTube') for each video URL found.
    - Returns a playlist_result with the entries and the user_id as the playlist id.
  - Important notes:
    - Aggregates multiple pages of user videos to form a complete playlist.
    - Uses a regex-based approach to dynamically discover video links within a user’s page.

Key implementation details
- Media URL discovery:
  - Considers multiple patterns to capture media URLs and media file paths across different player implementations.
  - Uses set(media_urls) to deduplicate before constructing formats for the video extractor.
- Quality handling:
  - Uses qualities(['mp3','flv','mp4']) to rank formats by file type.
  - determine_ext(media_url) helps assign an initial quality ranking per format.
- Metadata extraction:
  - Title: from meta tag, with cleanup of trailing ' - TeacherTube'.
  - Description: from meta tag if present.
  - Thumbnail: prefers OpenGraph thumbnail, falls back to meta thumbnail.
- Formats and ordering:
  - Formats are sorted with _sort_formats to choose best available stream order.
- Error handling:
  - Detects error messages in the page markup and raises ExtractorError with the site name included for clarity.

Tests and expectations
- _TEST entries demonstrate:
  - A flowplayer-based video with mp4 format and a specific MD5 for verification.
  - A jwplayer-based audio with mp3 format and its own MD5.
  - An unavailable video marked as only_matching to indicate non-extractable/unreachable content.
- TeacherTubeUserIE _TEST shows a typical user profile URL and a playlist_mincount expectation, validating that a non-trivial number of items is collected.

In short, this file provides two extractors for Teachertube: one for individual media items (handling multiple player implementations and direct media URLs) and one for user/collection pages (building a complete video/audio playlist by scraping initial and subsequent AJAX pages).
