Concise but comprehensive summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/mediaset.py

Purpose
- Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for Mediaset content served via Mediaset Play, using ThePlatform (TP) metadata and SMIL-based formats to retrieve video streams and metadata.

Key class
- MediasetIE, subclass of ThePlatformBaseIE
  - Uses ThePlatform API (TP) to fetch streaming formats and related data.
  - Overrides several methods to tailor Mediaset’s delivery and embedding quirks.

Main functionality and flow
- URL matching
  - _VALID_URL detects either mediaset: URIs or HTTP(S) Mediaset Play URLs, extracting a 16+ character alphanumeric program GUID.
- Program/embed URL discovery
  - Static method _extract_urls(ie, webpage) scans a page for iframe embeds pointing to Mediaset’s player (playerIFrame or Twitter variant).
  - Extracts programGuid from the iframe URL query string; if present, adds the embed URL to results.
  - If programGuid is not present, looks for an id in the query, fetches the embed URL (redirect), and re-checks for programGuid to include the embed.
  - This supports discovering multiple embed URLs from a page.
- SMIL/format handling
  - _parse_smil_formats override tweaks video source URLs found in SMIL to normalize/clean them:
    - Modifies the src attribute of each video element to remove or normalize certain query parameters, targeting a URL pattern like (https?://vod05)t(-mediaset-it.akamaized.net/.+?.mpd).
  - Then delegates to ThePlatformBaseIE’s _parse_smil_formats for standard parsing.
- Real extraction process (_real_extract)
  - Derives the ThePlatform GUID from the URL.
  - Builds a ThePlatform path tp_path = 'PR1GhC/media/guid/2702976343/' + guid and fetches base metadata via _extract_theplatform_metadata(tp_path, guid).
  - Formats and subtitles collection:
    - Iterates asset_type = SD, HD.
    - For each asset_type, tries formats in this order: MPEG4, MPEG-DASH+none, M3U+none by calling _extract_theplatform_smil on URLs like:
      http://link.theplatform.eu/s/PR1GhC (TP TLD eu) /s/<tp_path>, with query parameters mbr=true, formats=<format>, assetTypes=<asset_type>.
    - If a call raises ExtractorError, stores the first exception (first_e) and stops trying that asset_type/format combo, but continues with others if possible.
    - On success, marks HD formats with higher quality (HD = 1, SD = 0), aggregates formats, and merges subtitles.
  - Error handling
    - If a first exception occurred and no formats were collected, raises the first exception.
    - Sorts the formats list for consistent ordering.
  - Supplemental metadata from ThePlatform feed
    - Downloads additional data from ThePlatform feed API:
      https://feed.entertainment.tv.theplatform.eu/f/PR1GhC/mediaset-prod-all-programs/guid/-/{guid}
      with specific fields: tvSeasonNumber, tvSeasonEpisodeNumber, mediasetprogram$brandTitle, mediasetprogram$publishInfo, mediasetprogram$numberOfViews, etc.
    - If feed data is present, enriches info with:
      - episode_number, season_number (integers)
      - series (brandTitle)
      - uploader and uploader_id (from publishInfo)
      - view_count (numberOfViews)
  - Final metadata assembly
    - Sets info['id'] = guid
    - Attaches formats and subtitles
    - Returns the info dictionary
- Tests
  - _TESTS contain multiple real-world URLs for full episodes, clips, and various embed patterns.
  - Some tests are marked only_matching for non-video or embed-only URLs.
  - Expected metadata includes id, ext, title, description, thumbnail, duration, upload_date, series, timestamp, uploader, uploader_id, etc.

Important implementation details
- ThePlatform integration
  - Relies on ThePlatformBaseIE helper methods to fetch:
    - _extract_theplatform_metadata(tp_path, guid)
    - _extract_theplatform_smil(url, guid, note)
    - _download_json(url, guid, fatal=False, query=...)
    - _merge_subtitles(subs_a, subs_b)
  - Uses ThePlatform TLD eu for link construction.
- Robustness and fallbacks
  - Tracks first ExtractorError encountered across SMIL fetch attempts; if no formats are obtained and an error occurred, it raises the first error.
  - Attempts multiple SMIL/format combinations per SD/HD to maximize chance of success.
- URL construction and helpers
  - Uses update_url_query to add query params like mbr and formats to ThePlatform SMIL URLs.
  - Uses compat_parse_qs and compat_urllib_parse_urlparse for safe query extraction in _extract_urls.
  - Uses int_or_none to safely coerce numeric fields from feed data.
- Data enrichment
  - Separates base metadata from extended data fetched from ThePlatform feed API to populate series, uploader, and view counts when available.

In short
- This extractor retrieves Mediaset content via ThePlatform, supporting both full episodes and clips.
- It discovers embed URLs, normalizes SMIL-based formats, gathers SD/HD streams, handles subtitles, and enriches metadata with ThePlatform feed data (episode/season numbers, series, uploader, views).
- It has special handling for Mediaset-specific iframe and embed patterns and adjusts SMIL video sources to ensure valid manifest URLs.
