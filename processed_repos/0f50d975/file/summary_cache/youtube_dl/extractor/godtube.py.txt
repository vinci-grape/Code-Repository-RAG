- Purpose: GodTubeIE is an extractor for youtube-dl that handles GodTube watch pages and returns standard video metadata and the direct video URL.

- URL pattern:
  - _VALID_URL matches: http(s)://(www.)?godtube.com/watch/?v=<id>
  - The video id is captured as the group 'id'.

- Tests:
  - Includes a sample with id 0C0CNNNU.
  - Verifies expected metadata: id, extension (mp4), title, duration (159), timestamp (1205712000), uploader, upload_date (20080317), and a thumbnail URL pattern.

- Core functionality (_real_extract):
  - Extracts video_id from the URL using the regex.
  - Downloads the player config XML from:
    http://www.godtube.com/resource/mediaplayer/<video_id>.xml
    (video_id is lowercased for the request path)
  - Parses the config XML to obtain:
    - video_url from the <file> element
    - uploader from the <author> element
    - timestamp from the ISO8601 date in <date> using parse_iso8601
    - duration from <duration> using parse_duration
    - thumbnail from <image>
  - Downloads a second XML with media details from:
    http://www.godtube.com/media/xml/?v=<video_id>
  - Parses the title from the <title> element of this media XML.
  - Returns a dictionary containing:
    - id: video_id
    - url: video_url (the direct video URL)
    - title: title parsed from media XML
    - thumbnail: thumbnail URL
    - timestamp: parsed upload timestamp
    - uploader: uploader/author
    - duration: parsed duration (in seconds)

- Implementation details:
  - Uses InfoExtractor._download_xml to fetch both XML resources.
  - Uses two separate XML sources: one for technical/metadata (file, author, date, duration, image) and one for the title (title) from the media XML.
  - Duration and timestamp are converted to numeric formats via parse_duration and parse_iso8601.
  - The extension is inferred from the video URL (the test expects mp4, but the code does not hardcode an ext).

- Notes:
  - The approach relies on GodTubeâ€™s two XML endpoints and specific XML structure; changes to those endpoints/fields could require updates.
  - The code focuses on conveying enough metadata for the video entry and providing the direct media URL for download/streaming.
