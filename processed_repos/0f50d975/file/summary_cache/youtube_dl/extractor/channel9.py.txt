This file implements a Channel 9 extractor for youtube-dl (Channel9IE). It handles both individual Channel 9 content pages and RSS/playlist feeds, extracting video formats, metadata, and related assets.

Main components and functionality
- Class Channel9IE(InfoExtractor)
  - Description and name: IE_DESC = 'Channel 9', IE_NAME = 'channel9'
  - _VALID_URL: Regex that matches Channel 9 URLs (including channel9.msdn.com and short s.ch9.msd) and captures contentPath and optional RSS segment.
  - _RSS_URL: Base URL used to fetch RSS feeds for a given content path.
  - _extract_urls(webpage): Static method that extracts iframe URLs pointing to Channel 9 players from a page (used for discovering content embeds).
  - _extract_list(video_id, rss_url=None): Fetches an RSS feed for a given content path and builds a playlist from the <item><link> entries. Returns a playlist result with the title taken from the RSS feed.
  - _real_extract(url): Core extraction logic:
    - If URL ends with /RSS, delegates to _extract_list(content_path, url).
    - Otherwise downloads the page and looks for the data-episode attribute. If present:
      - Parses episode data JSON, obtains contentId and API endpoint, and detects if it is a session ('/Sessions(' in the API path).
      - Builds an OData content URL and fetches content data (JSON) including fields like Title, Description/Body, MediaLengthInSeconds, PublishedDate, Rating, Views, Captions, Slides, ZipFile, Authors, Speakers, VideoMP4* and VideoWMV* URLs.
      - Builds available formats in two stages:
        1) In-page formats from a <select name="format"> element. Each option contributes a format with a URL, a human-readable format label, and a derived internal format_id (via SITE_QUALITIES mapping). mp3 is marked with vcodec: 'none'.
        2) Additional formats from API fields (VideoMP4Low, VideoWMV, VideoMP4Medium, VideoMP4High, VideoWMVHQ). Dedupe against already collected URLs.
      - Determines subtitles from Captions (per-language, with .vtt extension).
      - Collects common metadata: id, title, description, thumbnail, duration, timestamp, ratings, view counts, subtitles.
      - If a session: collects speakers (FullName) and adds session_code, session_room, session_speakers; else collects authors (DisplayName) and adds authors.
      - Constructs possible content items:
        - Slides (title + '-Slides', slides URL)
        - Zip (title + '-Zip', zip URL)
        - Main video formats (title, with 'formats' list)
      - Returns a playlist_result of these contents (a single item for the main video plus optional slides/zip as separate items).
      - If nothing meaningful is found (no formats, slides, or zip), raises ExtractorError.
    - If no episode_data is found on the page, falls back to _extract_list(content_path) (i.e., treat as a RSS/playlist index).

Key implementation details
- Formats handling
  - Two sources for formats: in-page <select> options and API-provided URLs (VideoMP4Low/Medium/High, VideoWMV variants).
  - QUALITY handling via:
    - QUALITIES = ('mp3','wmv','mp4','wmv-low','mp4-low','wmv-mid','mp4-mid','wmv-high','mp4-high')
    - quality_key = qualities(QUALITIES) provides a consistent quality ranking.
    - A helper quality(quality_id, format_url) returns a large number (len(QUALITIES)) if the format URL contains '_Source.' (special case for source media), otherwise uses quality_key(quality_id).
  - Dedupe logic using a set of URLs to avoid duplicates from both sources.
  - vcodec is set to 'none' for mp3 formats (audio-only) and left as None otherwise.
  - Formats are sorted with _sort_formats(formats) before use.
- Metadata and content structure
  - Subtitles collected from Captions as language → list of {url, ext: 'vtt'} entries.
  - Common metadata includes:
    - id, title, description (cleaned HTML from Description or Body), thumbnail, duration, timestamp, avg_rating, rating_count, view_count, comment_count, subtitles.
  - Session-specific fields: session_code, session_room, session_speakers (list of speaker names).
  - Non-session videos: authors (list of author names).
- Attachments
  - Slides and ZipFile are treated as separate content items in the final playlist, each inheriting the common metadata but with a distinct title (title + '-Slides', title + '-Zip').
- RSS handling
  - RSS-based extraction uses _extract_list to convert channel/item/link entries into a playlist, with each link turned into a Channel9IE object via url_result (so nested extraction happens).
  - The _TESTS include RSS playlist examples and “only_matching” tests to verify URL matching without full extraction.

Usage scenarios supported
- Direct content pages with data-episode attribute: fetchs OData content, gathers formats, slides, zip, captions, authors/speakers, and returns a playlist with one main item plus optional attachments.
- Channel 9 RSS pages: fetches RSS and creates a playlist from item links.
- Pages with in-page format select: collects formats from the select options.
- Handles both sessions (talks) and non-sessions (blog posts or generic videos) with appropriate metadata fields.

Overall, Channel9IE provides robust support for Channel 9’s video content and RSS playlists, extracting multiple formats, subtitles, and rich metadata, and organizing slides/zip files as separate playlist items when available.
