Here’s a concise, comprehensive summary of the Medialaan extractor:

- Purpose
  - Implemented as MedialaanIE, a YouTube-dl extractor for Medialaan/MyChannels video content. It fetches video metadata and formats from Medialaan’s embed system and exposes them in the standard youtube-dl InfoExtractor format.

- URL matching and tests
  - _VALID_URL is a verbose regex that matches a variety of Medialaan embedding/production URLs, including:
    - https://embed.mychannels.video/.../production/{id}
    - https://mychannels.video/embed/{id}
    - Various Be/NL media sites that redirect to the same underlying production
  - _TESTS contains samples:
    - A real video URL with expected id, title, timestamp, duration, and mp4 extension
    - Several “only_matching” entries to validate URL recognition

- URL extraction helper
  - _extract_urls(webpage): static method that scans a webpage for divs with data-mychannels-type="video" and reads data-mychannels-id. If found, it constructs and returns the embed URL https://mychannels.video/embed/{id}.
  - This enables extraction from pages that contain embedded Medialaan videos.

- Core extraction logic
  - _real_extract(url):
    - production_id = extracted id from URL using _match_id.
    - Retrieves production data from https://embed.mychannels.video/sdk/production/{production_id} with query options=UUUU_default.
    - The response’s productions array is used; the first production entry is taken.
    - title = production['title'].

  - Formats construction:
    - Iterates over production.get('sources') (defaulting to empty list if missing).
    - For each source with a 'src':
      - ext = mimetype2ext(source.get('type')) to determine file extension.
      - If ext == 'm3u8':
        - Uses _extract_m3u8_formats(src, production_id, 'mp4', 'm3u8_native', m3u8_id='hls', fatal=False) to parse HLS formats and extend the formats list.
      - Else:
        - Append a simple format dict {'ext': ext, 'url': src}.
    - self._sort_formats(formats) to order formats by preference/quality.

  - Return structure:
    - id: production_id
    - title: as fetched
    - formats: list of formats built above
    - thumbnail: posterUrl from production
    - timestamp: parsed via parse_iso8601(production.get('publicationDate'), ' ')
    - duration: int_or_none(production.get('duration')) or None

- Important implementation details
  - Uses utility helpers:
    - extract_attributes to parse HTML tag attributes.
    - mimetype2ext to map MIME types to file extensions.
    - parse_iso8601 to convert publicationDate strings to Unix timestamps.
    - int_or_none to safely convert duration to int.
  - Supports both direct video URLs (e.g., mp4) and HLS (m3u8) streams.
  - The duration and timestamp are optional-safe: duration may be None if not provided; timestamp is parsed if publicationDate exists.
  - The _extract_urls function enables discovering embedded Medialaan videos from pages that include data-mychannels attributes.

In short, MedialaanIE fetches a production’s data from MyChannels SDK, collects all available video sources (direct URLs and HLS), normalizes formats, and returns a standard info dictionary with id, title, formats, thumbnail, timestamp, and duration.
