Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/caffeine.py

Overview
- Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for Caffeine.tv video pages.
- Class: CaffeineTVIE (inherits InfoExtractor).
- Purpose: fetch video metadata and formats from Caffeineâ€™s API and assemble a standard info dict for download.

Key components
- _VALID_URL: Regexp that matches Caffeine TV video URLs of the form https://www.caffeine.tv/<user>/video/<video-id> where video-id is a hex-like string with dashes.
- _TESTS: Includes a sample URL and expected info dict (id, ext, title, timestamp, upload_date, uploader, duration, age_limit) with a bestvideo format.

Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
- Extract video_id from the URL using _match_id.
- Retrieve JSON data from the Caffeine API:
  - URL: https://api.caffeine.tv/social/public/activity/<video_id>
  - Call: _download_json(...)
- Pull broadcast-related info:
  - broadcast_info = json_data['broadcast_info'] if present
  - title = broadcast_info['broadcast_title']
  - video_url = broadcast_info['video_url']
- Determine the media format:
  - ext = determine_ext(video_url)
  - If ext is m3u8:
    - formats = _extract_m3u8_formats(video_url, video_id, 'mp4', entry_protocol='m3u8', fatal=False)
  - Else:
    - formats = [{'url': video_url}]
  - Sort formats with _sort_formats(formats)

- Build the final info dictionary via merge_dicts, composed of:
  - Base fields:
    - id: video_id
    - title: title
    - formats: formats
  - json_data-derived fields (via traverse_obj, get_all=False):
    - uploader: extracted from json_data.user.username (and/or user.name in other mappings)
    - like_count, view_count, comment_count (cast to int)
    - tags (as text)
    - is_live (boolean)
  - broadcast_info-derived fields:
    - duration: mapped from content_duration (int or None)
    - timestamp: parsed from broadcast_start_time using parse_iso8601 (converted to Unix timestamp)
    - thumbnail: built from preview_image_path via urljoin(page_url, thumbnail_path)
    - age_limit: mapped from content_rating via a small mapping:
      - If content_rating is e.g. 'NINE_PLUS', map to 9, 'TWELVE_PLUS' to 12, 'SEVENTEEN_PLUS' to 17, etc.
      - The default is 17 if rating is unknown or missing.
    - The mapping includes a specific handling inspired by Apple Store ratings:
      - FOUR_PLUS -> 0
      - NINE_PLUS -> 9
      - TWELVE_PLUS -> 12
      - SEVENTEEN_PLUS -> 17

Implementation details and utilities
- Uses a number of helper utilities:
  - determine_ext: derive file extension from URL
  - int_or_none: safely parse integers
  - merge_dicts: merge multiple dicts into a single info dict
  - parse_iso8601: parse ISO8601 timestamps
  - T: type wrapper used within traverse_obj for casting
  - traverse_obj: robust, nested data extraction with mapping rules
  - txt_or_none: convert to text if possible
  - urljoin: construct absolute URLs for thumbnails
- Robust handling of two possible video URL formats:
  - If video_url points to an HLS stream (m3u8), formats are extracted using _extract_m3u8_formats with entry_protocol='m3u8' and fatal=False to avoid failing when no formats are available.
  - If video_url is a direct file, a single format dictionary with that URL is used.
- The final info dict includes both common fields (id, title, uploader, etc.) and derived fields (timestamp, upload_date, duration, etc.), enabling downstream consumers to access standard metadata.

What this enables
- Automated extraction of Caffeine.tv videos, including:
  - Title, uploader
  - Video formats (including HLS when applicable)
  - Duration, timestamps (upload date), and age restrictions
  - View/like/comment counts and tags
  - Thumbnail URL construction
- Graceful handling of missing or varying data structures via traverse_obj and safe casting.
