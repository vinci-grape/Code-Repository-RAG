Here is a concise yet comprehensive summary of the code in youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/eroprofile.py.

Purpose
- Implement a YouTube-dl extractor for eroprofile.com video pages under /m/videos/view/<id>.
- Supports both publicly accessible videos and those that require user login.
- Handles login via standard form POST, with credentials from netrc or user input.

Key components
- Class: EroProfileIE(InfoExtractor)
  - Inherits from youtube-dl’s InfoExtractor.
  - Provides login support and video metadata extraction.

URL handling and matching
- _VALID_URL: Regular expression matching URLs like:
  - http(s)://www.eroprofile.com/m/videos/view/<id>
  - Captures the video ID part as 'id' for use as display_id.
- _TESTS: Two test cases
  - Public video: checks id, display_id, ext, title, thumbnail, age_limit, md5, and skip condition if video not found.
  - Video requiring login: checks fields but marked to skip unless logged in.

Login flow
- _LOGIN_URL: Base login URL (http://www.eroprofile.com/auth/auth.php?)
- _NETRC_MACHINE: 'eroprofile' (credentials can be provided via a netrc file)
- _real_initialize: Triggers login before extraction by calling _login.
- _login:
  - Retrieves credentials via self._get_login_info() (netrc or prompt).
  - If no credentials, returns early.
  - Builds a login URL with username, password, and a redirect url to http://www.eroprofile.com/.
  - Downloads the login page and checks for a failure message: "Your username or password was incorrect." If found, raises ExtractorError with expected=True to signal incorrect login.
  - On success, calls report_login() to mark successful login.
  - Extracts a redirect URL from a script tag source in the login page and follows it to complete login.
- This flow ensures cookies are stored for subsequent extraction attempts.

Video extraction
- _real_extract(url):
  - display_id = self._match_id(url) (the id part captured by _VALID_URL)
  - Downloads the video page HTML.
  - If page content contains "You must be logged in to view this video.", raises login required error.
  - video_id extraction:
    - Tries two patterns via self._search_regex:
      - glbUpdViews('\d*','(\d+)')
      - p/report/video/(\d+)
    - The first match yields the actual numeric video_id; default=None if not found.
  - Title extraction:
    - Attempts two HTML patterns via self._html_search_regex:
      - Title:</th><td>([^<]+)</td>
      - <h1>...</h1> (captures title text)
  - info = self._parse_html5_media_entries(url, webpage, video_id)[0]
    - This uses a helper that parses HTML5 media entries embedded in the page and returns a list of info dicts; the code uses the first one.
  - Return value: merge_dicts(info, {
      'id': video_id,
      'display_id': display_id,
      'title': title,
      'age_limit': 18,
    })
    - Merges the parsed media info with explicit fields:
      - id: internal numeric video_id
      - display_id: the slug from the URL
      - title: extracted title
      - age_limit: 18 (adult content)

Important implementation details
- Dependencies/utilities:
  - InfoExtractor base class
  - compat_urllib_parse_urlencode for login query encoding
  - utils: ExtractorError, merge_dicts
  - Helpers: _download_webpage, _search_regex, _html_search_regex, _parse_html5_media_entries
- Encoding compatibility:
  - Uses from __future__ import unicode_literals for Python 2/3 compatibility.
- Error handling:
  - Raises ExtractorError with expected=True when login credentials are incorrect.
  - Raises login required when attempting to access a video that requires login.
- Data handling:
  - Falls back gracefully if certain patterns aren’t found (video_id, title).
  - The final result includes a mix of parsed media info and explicit fields (id, display_id, title, age_limit).

In short
- This extractor authenticates with eroprofile when needed, detects and fetches a video’s numeric ID and title from the page, uses the page’s HTML5 media entries to build a metadata dictionary, and outputs a merged dict suitable for youtube-dl’s standard video information flow. It robustly handles both public and login-protected videos and uses netrc-friendly authentication.
