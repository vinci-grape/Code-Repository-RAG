Here's a concise but comprehensive summary of the HiDive extractor code.

Purpose
- Implement a YouTube-dl (or similar) extractor for HiDive streaming URLs.
- Supports optional login, fetches video playback settings, parses available formats and subtitles, and returns a standard info dictionary.

Key classes / functions
- HiDiveIE(InfoExtractor): Main extractor class.
  - _VALID_URL: Regex pattern for HiDive stream URLs, captures title and key:
    https://www.hidive.com/stream/{title}/{key}
  - _GEO_BYPASS: Disabled (False) due to 403 issues with X-Forwarded-For when bypassing geo restrictions.
  - _NETRC_MACHINE, _LOGIN_URL: Netrc machine name and login URL for HiDive.
  - _TESTS: Contains a test case (requires authentication) with expected id, ext, title, series, season_number, and episode_number. Marked to skip if authentication isn’t available.
  - _real_initialize(self): Attempts to log in if credentials are provided.
    - Retrieves login info (email/password) via _get_login_info.
    - Downloads the login page, extracts the login form, collects hidden inputs, adds Email/Password, and posts to log in.
  - _real_extract(self, url): Core extraction logic.
    - Parses URL to extract title and key, builds video_id as "title/key".
    - Calls https://www.hidive.com/play/settings with Title, Key, and a fixed PlayerId to obtain rendition/settings data.
    - Handles regional restrictions: if restrictionReason is RegionRestricted, raises geo restriction; if another restriction exists (and not None), raises an ExtractorError with the provided message.
    - Iterates over settings['renditions']:
      - If bitrates is a dict and contains an HLS URL, adds HLS formats via _extract_m3u8_formats (entry_protocol m3u8_native, m3u8_id suffixed with rendition_id, non-fatal on error).
      - If ccFiles (subtitles) exist and are properly structured (list of [lang, _, url]), adds to subtitles under the corresponding language.
    - Sorts the collected formats with _sort_formats.
    - Attempts to extract season_number and episode_number from the key using patterns s(\d+) and e(\d+).
    - Returns a dict with:
      - id: video_id
      - title: video_id
      - subtitles: collected subtitles
      - formats: collected and sorted formats
      - series: title
      - season_number: parsed season
      - episode_number: parsed episode

Important implementation details
- Authentication
  - _real_initialize handles optional login. If no credentials are provided, extraction proceeds without login.
  - Login flow parses the login form and posts credentials securely via urlencode_postdata.
- API interaction
  - Uses the play/settings endpoint to fetch video settings, including renditions and ccFiles for subtitles.
  - A fixed PlayerId is used in the request; this is likely required by HiDive’s API.
- Formats and subtitles
  - Only HLS (m3u8) formats are extracted from the renditions’ bitrates when an HLS URL is provided.
  - Subtitles are collected from ccFiles, which are expected as [language, something, url].
- Error handling
  - Region-restricted videos trigger geo-restriction handling.
  - Other non-None restrictions raise a descriptive ExtractorError.
- Metadata
  - The returned info dict uses:
    - id and title set to video_id ("title/key")
    - series set to the extracted title
    - season_number and episode_number derived from the key (sXXeYY)
- Notes on limitations
  - _GEO_BYPASS is disabled due to observed 403 errors when bypassing geo checks.
  - The loader expects a specific HiDive login flow and may require valid credentials to access many streams (as indicated by the test case).

In short, this extractor logs in if possible, fetches HiDive playback settings, builds a list of available HLS video formats and captions, handles geo/other access restrictions, and returns a standard information dictionary suitable for streaming.
