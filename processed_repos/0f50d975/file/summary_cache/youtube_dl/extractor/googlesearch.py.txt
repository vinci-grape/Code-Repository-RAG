Concise but comprehensive summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/googlesearch.py

Purpose
- Implements a Google Video search extractor for youtube-dl. It fetches a list of video URLs from Google’s video search results and returns them as a playlist-like entry.

Key class
- GoogleSearchIE (subclass of SearchInfoExtractor)
  - IE_DESC: "Google Video search"
  - IE_NAME: 'video.google:search'
  - _SEARCH_KEY: 'gvsearch' (used by youtube-dl to trigger this extractor via search syntax)
  - _MAX_RESULTS: 1000 (maximum results supported)
  - _TEST: demonstrates usage with gvsearch15:python language, expecting a playlist with 15 items and id/title equal to the query.

Main functionality
- _get_n_results(self, query, n)
  - Purpose: Retrieve up to n video results for the given query.
  - Creates a playlist-like result with:
    - '_type': 'playlist'
    - 'id': query
    - 'title': query
  - Iterates through Google search result pages (pagination) using page numbers via itertools.count().
  - For each page:
    - Downloads the Google search results page for videos:
      - URL: http://www.google.com/search
      - Query params: tbm=vid, q=query, start=pagenum*10, hl=en
      - Uses _download_webpage with a note indicating which result page is being downloaded.
    - Parses video result links with regex: <h3 class="r"><a href="([^"]+)"
      - Captures candidate video URLs from anchor tags.
    - Filters candidates to actual video results by checking for the presence of a corresponding thumbnail element in the page:
      - Requires id="vidthumbN" where N matches the result index (hit_idx + 1).
      - If this condition fails, the result is skipped (ensures the item is a real video result, not other types of results).
    - Appends each valid result as:
      - {'_type': 'url', 'url': captured_url}
    - Terminates when either:
      - The number of collected entries >= n, or
      - There is no next page indicator (no id="pnnext" on the page).
    - If not finished, continues to the next page (start increases by 10).
  - After termination, assigns res['entries'] = entries[:n] and returns the result.

Implementation details
- HTML parsing is done with regular expressions, relying on Google’s page structure (h3 class="r" for results and id="vidthumbN" for corresponding thumbnails).
- Uses Google search parameter tbm=vid to limit results to videos.
- Start index for paging uses 10 results per page (start = pagenum * 10).
- Returns a playlist object where each item is a simple URL entry.
- Robustness: The approach is brittle because it depends on Google’s HTML markup (subject to breaking changes). It also relies on the specific id-naming convention (vidthumb) and the presence of a pnnext link for pagination.

Notes
- The _TEST block demonstrates how the extractor would be invoked via the gvsearch syntax and what type of information is expected (playlist with a specific id/title and a count of entries).
- The code is designed to integrate with youtube-dl’s search framework through the _SEARCH_KEY and the base class, enabling users to perform Google Video searches and retrieve video URLs as a playlist.
