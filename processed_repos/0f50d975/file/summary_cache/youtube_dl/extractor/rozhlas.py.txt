Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/rozhlas.py

- Purpose
  - Implement a YouTube-DL extractor (RozhlasIE) for audio pages on rozhlas.cz ( Czech Radio ).

- Key class
  - RozhlasIE(InfoExtractor): Subclass that defines how to parse Rozhlas audio pages.

- URL pattern
  - _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?prehravac\.rozhlas\.cz/audio/(?P<id>[0-9]+)'
  - Matches pages like http://prehravac.rozhlas.cz/audio/3421320

- Tests
  - _TESTS includes:
    - A typical page URL with expected md5, id, ext mp3, title, and description.
    - An embed URL http://prehravac.rozhlas.cz/audio/3421320/embed with only_matching: True (ensures the embed URL does not get treated as a match for this extractor).

- Main extraction flow (_real_extract)
  - Extracts audio_id from the URL using _match_id.
  - Downloads the page content from http://prehravac.rozhlas.cz/audio/{audio_id}.
  - Title extraction:
    - Primary: tries to parse a specific HTML structure to grab the title with a regex targeting:
      <h3>...</h3> followed by a paragraph and a div with id="player-track".
    - Fallback: uses the page OpenGraph title via _og_search_title and strips a leading "Radio Wave - " prefix with remove_start.
  - Description extraction:
    - Uses a regex to capture a URL found inside a paragraph with a title attribute, within a div with id="player-track".
    - Marked fatal=False to avoid failing if not present; stores the captured URL as description.
  - Duration extraction:
    - Looks for data-duration="digits" in the page and converts it to an int via int_or_none.
  - Resource URL:
    - Constructs the MP3 URL as http://media.rozhlas.cz/_audio/{audio_id}.mp3
  - Return payload:
    - id: audio_id
    - url: MP3 URL
    - title: extracted title
    - description: extracted description (or None)
    - duration: duration in seconds (or None)
    - vcodec: 'none' (no video)

- Important implementation details
  - Uses utilities: int_or_none, remove_start.
  - Uses multiple extraction strategies to robustly obtain title (primary HTML parse with a fallback to OpenGraph title).
  - The final media URL is a simple MP3 endpoint separate from the page content.
  - Provides a minimal, yet comprehensive metadata set: id, title, description, duration, and direct MP3 URL.
