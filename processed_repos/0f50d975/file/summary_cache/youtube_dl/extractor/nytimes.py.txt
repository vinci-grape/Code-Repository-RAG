Concise but comprehensive summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/nytimes.py

Overview
- This file implements NYTimes-related extractors for youtube-dl:
  - NYTimesBaseIE: shared logic to fetch and parse NYTimes video data, including authorization, formats, thumbnails, and metadata.
  - NYTimesIE: handles NYTimes video pages (standard video embeds).
  - NYTimesArticleIE: handles NYTimes article pages that may contain either a video or a podcast.
  - NYTimesCookingIE: handles NYTimes Cooking site video content.

Key classes and main functionality
- NYTimesBaseIE
  - _SECRET: A hard-coded secret key used to generate an authorization signature.
  - _extract_video_from_id(video_id):
    - Builds a request path /svc/video/api/v3/video/{video_id}.
    - Generates an HMAC-SHA512 signature using the secret over "path:vhs" and hex-digests it.
    - Sends a request to http://www.nytimes.com{path} with headers:
      - Authorization: NYTV base64(hmac_signature)
      - X-NYTV: vhs
    - If the v3 endpoint fails (fatal=False), falls back to http://www.nytimes.com/svc/video/api/v2/video/{video_id}.
    - Parses video_data to extract:
      - title (video_data['headline']), description (video_data.get('summary')), uploader (video_data.get('byline')), and publication_date.
      - formats: iterates over video_data['renditions']:
        - Skips thumbnails and duplicates.
        - Determines extension via mimetype or URL.
        - If m3u8: uses _extract_m3u8_formats to build formats (mp4 container, m3u8_native, with m3u8_id).
        - If mpd: currently skipped (commented out in code).
        - Otherwise: builds a format dict with url, format_id, vcodec, width, height, filesize, tbr, ext.
      - Sorts formats by height, width, filesize, tbr, fps, and format_id.
      - thumbnails: builds list from video_data['images'], prefixing image URLs with http://www.nytimes.com/.
      - timestamp: derived from publication_date via parse_iso8601(publication_date[:-8]) to strip timezone.
    - Returns a dict with id, title, description, timestamp, uploader, duration (float seconds), formats, and thumbnails.
  - Important notes:
    - Handles both v3 and v2 NYTimes video APIs, with a robust fallback.
    - Supports HLS (m3u8) formats and direct file formats; mpd support is present but not active (commented).

- NYTimesIE (video extractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Accepts NYTimes video URLs and graphics embed URLs (with videoId parameter).
  - _TESTS: Includes sample NYTimes video page and a non-matching URL.
  - _real_extract(url): extracts video_id via _match_id and delegates to _extract_video_from_id(video_id) from NYTimesBaseIE.

- NYTimesArticleIE (article page extractor)
  - _VALID_URL: Broad pattern for NYTimes article URLs, excluding direct video paths.
  - _TESTS: Covers videos embedded in NYTimes articles and podcast pages.
  - _extract_podcast_from_json(self, json, page_id, webpage):
    - Parses a JSON blob (embedded in the page) into a Python dict.
    - Extracts track and episode information:
      - episode_title, video_url (track['source']).
      - description: track['description'] or og/twitter meta descriptions.
      - podcast_title (podcast title if present) and constructs a combined title.
      - episode, episode_number (extracted via regex on episode text).
      - duration (track['duration']).
    - Returns a dict with id, url, title, description, creator, series, episode, episode_number, duration.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Downloads the page and tries to locate a video_id in data-videoid attribute; if found, uses _extract_video_from_id.
    - Otherwise, extracts a podcast JSON object embedded in the page via patterns that match NYTD.FlexTypes.push({ ... }) scripts.
    - Delegates to _extract_podcast_from_json for the final InfoDict.

- NYTimesCookingIE (Cooking site)
  - _VALID_URL: Matches NYTimes Cooking recipe pages (recipes and guides) using cooking.nytimes.com.
  - _TESTS: Includes two sample cooking URLs with expected metadata.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts video_id from data-video-id in the page.
    - Delegates to _extract_video_from_id(video_id) (shared logic from NYTimesBaseIE).

Key implementation details
- Authorization/signature
  - The NYTimes video API requires a signed Authorization header derived from HMAC-SHA512 over the path and a fixed suffix. The code mirrors reverse-engineered logic from NYTimesâ€™ signer.
  - First tries v3 endpoint; on failure, falls back to v2 endpoint to maximize compatibility.

- Formats extraction
  - For each rendition, the code builds a format entry:
    - Direct video URLs include metadata like vcodec, width, height, filesize, tbr (bitrate), and extension.
    - m3u8 (HLS) URLs are expanded with _extract_m3u8_formats, using 'mp4' as the container and m3u8_native handling.
    - mpd (DASH) is present but currently not added to formats (commented-out code).
  - Formats are sorted by multiple keys to present the best quality first.

- Thumbnails and metadata
  - Thumbnails are gathered from video_data['images'] and prefixed with the NYTimes domain.
  - Publication date is parsed to a UNIX timestamp with parse_iso8601; the code trims timezone information as publication_date[:-8].

- Podcast extraction from article pages
  - The code handles NYT podcast data embedded in article pages via a JSON blob in a script tag (NYTD.FlexTypes.push(...)).
  - It uses _parse_json with js_to_json to safely convert the embedded JavaScript-like JSON into Python data.
  - It assembles a comprehensive InfoDict including id, title, description, series, episode, episode_number, duration, and creator.

- Robust URL matching and tests
  - Each extractor defines _VALID_URL patterns for its targets and includes _TESTS with sample URLs and expected metadata to validate behavior.

Summary
- This file provides NYTimes video/article/podcast extraction logic for youtube-dl, centered around a shared NYTimesBaseIE for authenticated video data retrieval and format parsing.
- It supports NYTimes video pages, NYTimes article pages with podcasts or videos, and NYTimes Cooking video pages.
- The implementation includes a sophisticated authorization mechanism, versatile format extraction (including HLS), metadata handling (timestamps, descriptions, uploader/creator), and podcast data parsing from embedded JSON, with tests to verify functionality.
