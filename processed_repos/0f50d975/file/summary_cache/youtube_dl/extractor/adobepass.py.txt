Concise but comprehensive summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/adobepass.py

What it is for
- Implements an Adobe Pass (MVPD) authentication flow for youtube-dl. It handles obtaining authenticated tokens from participating MVPDs (MSOs) via service providers (SPs) and returns a short, usable authorization token for media access.
- Supports a wide range of MSOs through a large MSO_INFO mapping that defines each provider’s login form fields.

Key components
- MSO_INFO mapping
  - A large dictionary mapping MSO IDs (e.g., 'DTV', 'ATT', 'Comcast_SSO', 'Verizon', plus many smaller providers) to:
    - Display name (for user-friendly messages)
    - username_field and password_field (the form field names to submit for credentials)
  - Used to tailor login requests for each MSO during the Adobe Pass flow.

- AdobePassIE class (subclasses InfoExtractor)
  - _SERVICE_PROVIDER_TEMPLATE: base URL for ADOBE PASS service provider endpoints (https://sp.auth.adobe.com/adobe-services/%s)
  - _USER_AGENT: a Firefox-like user agent string to mimic a real browser
  - _MVPD_CACHE: cache key for storing MVPD tokens (authn/authz tokens per requestor)
  - _DOWNLOADING_LOGIN_PAGE: status string used when downloading login pages

- _download_webpage_handle override
  - Adds geo-verification headers (via geo_verification_headers()) to requests
  - Merges supplied headers and delegates to parent implementation

- _get_mvpd_resource(provider_id, title, guid, rating)
  - Builds a tiny RSS/Atom-like XML resource describing an MVPD resource
  - Returns an XML string containing a channel with a title and an item with title, guid, and a media rating
  - Likely used to supply a resource descriptor to some parts of the flow

- _extract_mvpd_auth(url, video_id, requestor_id, resource)
  - Core, multi-step Adobe Pass authentication flow
  - Inner helper utilities:
    - xml_text(xml_str, tag): extract value of an XML tag from a string using regex
    - is_expired(token, date_ele): determine if a token is expired using unified_timestamp
    - post_form(form_page_res, note, data): parse a form’s action URL, gather hidden inputs, merge data, and POST to the form
    - raise_mvpd_required(): raises an ExtractorError prompting for --ap-mso, --ap-username, and --ap-password (or netrc)
    - extract_redirect_url(html, url=None, fatal=False): parse HTML meta refresh redirects and return the absolute URL
  - mvpd_headers: base headers used for MVPD communication, including:
    - ap_42, ap_11, ap_z, and User-Agent
  - GUID logic:
    - guid = value extracted from resource if it contains XML, else use resource as-is
  - Main loop (up to 2 attempts):
    - Load requestor_info from cache (ap-mvpd). If an authn_token exists but is expired, drop it.
    - If missing authn_token:
      - Reads --ap_mso (MSO) parameter; if absent, raise
      - Retrieves credentials via _get_login_info using mso_id
      - Looks up mso_info in MSO_INFO
      - Starts provider redirect by hitting authenticate/saml with several query params (mso_id, requestor_id, etc.)
      - Special-cases for Comcast_SSO, Verizon, and general providers due to their different login flows:
        - Comcast_SSO:
          - Handles auto-login redirects, possible signin forms, http-equiv refresh redirects
          - Uses post_form to submit credentials and may handle extra confirmation steps
        - Verizon:
          - Sometimes requires no credentials on Verizon IPs; otherwise submits SAML login flow
          - Handles possible login failure message
          - Performs a SAML POST exchange and final confirmation
        - General case (other MSOs):
          - Follows provider redirect (including optional meta refresh redirects)
          - Submits login form with the MSO-specific username/password field names
          - If required, confirms login
      - After login, fetches a session from SP/session with requestor_id
      - If session indicates <pendingLogout>, clears cache and retries; otherwise stores authn_token in cache
    - authz_token flow:
      - Retrieve or fetch authz_token using SP/authorize with:
        - resource_id, requestor_id, authentication_token, mso_id, userMeta
      - Handle <pendingLogout> and <error> responses
      - Save authz_token in cache per guid
    - Update mvpd_headers with values from the authentication token:
      - simpleSamlNameID and simpleSamlSessionIndex
    - short authorization:
      - Call SP/shortAuthorize with authz_token, requestor_id, session_guid, hashed_guid
      - If <pendingLogout>, clear and retry
      - Return the short_authorize response (the final token/redirect payload used to access the video)
  - The file snippet ends with a “Summary:” placeholder, indicating the rest of the extractor (parsing formats, video metadata, etc.) is not shown here. The provided portion focuses entirely on the Adobe Pass MVPD authentication flow.

Main functionality and flow summary
- Purpose: Acquire a valid MVPD authorization token through the Adobe Pass protocol to authorize access to protected video content.
- Flow:
  1) Prepare credentials for a specific MSO (via --ap-mso, and --ap-username/password or netrc)
  2) Perform the SP redirect/login dance (provider page, possible SAML redirects, meta refresh redirects)
  3) Establish an authenticated session and obtain an authn_token
  4) Use the authn_token to request an authz_token for the specific resource
  5) Use the authz_token to fetch a short media token via shortAuthorize
  6) Cache tokens to minimize repeated logins and handle token expiry
- Robustness features:
  - Handles a variety of provider-specific flows (Comcast, Verizon, and many others with the large MSO mapping)
  - Manages redirects, including meta refresh redirects
  - Detects and handles <pendingLogout> states by retrying
  - Validates token expiry using unified_timestamp
  - Uses form parsing to submit credentials via hidden form fields
  - Caches tokens per requestor_id to speed subsequent requests

Notes
- The code is intricate due to the diversity of Adobe Pass flows across MVPDs and the need to simulate browser-like login sequences, including handling SAML exchanges and multiple redirect patterns.
- The snippet ends with a partial “Summary:” which suggests the rest of the extractor (parsing video formats, entries, etc.) is not included here. The shown portion is dedicated to the Adobe Pass authentication mechanism.
