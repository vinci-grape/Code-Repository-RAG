Concise summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/callin.py

- Purpose
  - Implement an extractor for Callin episode pages, enabling YouTube-dl to fetch video formats and metadata for Callin show episodes.

- Key class
  - CallinIE (inherits from InfoExtractor)
    - _VALID_URL: Regular expression matching Callin episode URLs and capturing the episode id at the end (the part after the last hyphen).
    - _TESTS: Two test cases with URLs, expected md5s, and info_dicts (id, ext, title, description, channel, channel_url). Used for automated testing.

- Main workflow
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts video_id from URL using _match_id.
    - Downloads the episode page HTML with _download_webpage.
    - Retrieves embedded Next.js data via _search_nextjs_data, which reads the __NEXT_DATA__ script block and parses its JSON.
    - Locates the episode data within the Next.js data at props.pageProps.episode using traverse_obj.
    - If episode data is missing, raises ExtractorError.
    - Title: episode['title'] if present, otherwise falls back to OpenGraph title from the page.
    - Description: episode['description'] if present, otherwise falls back to OpenGraph description.
    - Formats:
      - Creates a formats list by extracting HLS/MP4 formats from episode['m3u8'] using _extract_m3u8_formats with entry_protocol='m3u8_native' and fatal=False (so missing m3u8 won’t fail).
      - Sorts formats with _sort_formats.
    - Channel info:
      - channel: episode['show']['title'] if present (safely retrieved with try_get).
      - channel_url: episode['show']['linkObj']['resourceUrl'] if present (safely retrieved with try_get).
    - Returns a dict with:
      - id, title, description, formats, channel, channel_url

- Helper method
  - _search_nextjs_data(self, webpage, video_id, transform_source=None, fatal=True, **kw):
    - Extracts the JSON payload from the HTML by locating the script tag with id="__NEXT_DATA__" and parsing its content with _parse_json.
    - Returns the parsed data (used by _real_extract to find the episode information).

- Important implementation details
  - Data source: Relies on Next.js server-rendered data embedded in the page (__NEXT_DATA__ script) rather than a separate API endpoint.
  - Robust JSON traversal: Uses traverse_obj to safely access nested fields, and try_get to safely extract optional fields with proper type handling (compat_str).
  - Fallbacks: Title/description gracefully fall back to Open Graph metadata if episode data is incomplete.
  - Format handling: Uses _extract_m3u8_formats with fatal=False, allowing extraction to succeed even if m3u8 data is absent; formats are then sorted.
  - Output schema: Returns a standard YouTube-dl info dict containing id, title, description, formats, channel, and channel_url.

Overall, this extractor focuses on pulling the episode metadata and HLS/MP4 formats from Callin’s Next.js data embedded in the episode page and exposing them in a unified format for YouTube-dl.
