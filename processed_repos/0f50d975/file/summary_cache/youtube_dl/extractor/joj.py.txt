Summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/joj.py

Overview
- Implemented a YouTube-DL extractor for the JOJ media site (Slovakia).
- Class JojIE extends InfoExtractor and handles URLs for embedded JOJ videos.
- Supports extracting metadata (title, duration, thumbnail) and video formats from JOJ embed pages or a secondary XML playlist fallback.

Key components
- Class: JojIE(InfoExtractor)
- URL matching: _VALID_URL supports two modes
  - joj:<id> (custom scheme)
  - https://media.joj.sk/embed/<id> (or http)
  - The id is captured as a named group 'id'
- _TESTS: Includes a primary test for a known embed URL with expected info dict (id, ext, title, thumbnail, duration), plus several only_matching tests to ensure non-embed or wrong schemes are ignored.
- _extract_urls(webpage): Static method that scans a page for iframe embeds pointing to //media.joj.sk/embed/... and returns the matched embed URLs.
- _real_extract(self, url): Core extraction logic.
  - video_id: Extracted from the URL via _match_id.
  - webpage: Download the embed page at https://media.joj.sk/embed/<video_id>.
  - title: Try to extract in order:
    - videoTitle field from embedded JS or JSON-like structure
    - fall back to the <title> tag
    - fall back to OpenGraph title via _og_search_title
  - bitrates/format data:
    - Attempt to parse a JS object assigned to src or bitrates: look for a pattern like src = {...}; or bitrates = {...}; and convert with js_to_json.
    - If a 'mp4' key exists in the parsed object, iterate its URLs to build formats:
      - Detect height from the URL with a regex (\d+)[pP]\. and set format_id like "720p" and height as int.
  - Fallback formats (if no formats found from bitrates):
    - Download an XML playlist from https://media.joj.sk/services/Video.php?clip=<video_id>.
    - Iterate over /files/file entries:
      - path attribute provides the file location; skip if missing.
      - format_id from file id or label.
      - Build direct URL as http://n16.joj.sk/storage/<path-without-dat-prefix>.
      - Extract height from format_id or path via (\d+)[pP], if present, and convert to int.
  - _sort_formats(formats): Normalizes and sorts the collected formats.
  - thumbnail: Derived from OpenGraph data on the page via _og_search_thumbnail.
  - duration: Parsed from videoDuration: <number> in the page (optional, fatal=False).
  - Returns a dictionary with:
    - id: video_id
    - title
    - thumbnail
    - duration
    - formats: list of format dictionaries

Important implementation details
- Dependency helpers:
  - _download_webpage, _download_xml, _search_regex, _og_search_title, _og_search_thumbnail, _parse_json, _sort_formats, int_or_none, try_get, js_to_json are used to robustly fetch and parse data.
- Robust data extraction with fallbacks:
  - Title extraction uses multiple strategies to maximize success across JOJ pages.
  - Formats are first attempted from embedded JS/wrapper data (preferred) and then fall back to a traditional XML playlist if needed.
  - duration is optional and safely parsed with fatal=False.
- Data parsing specifics:
  - bitrates parsing uses a JS-to-JSON transformation to convert embedded JavaScript objects into Python data structures.
  - Height extraction relies on URL or format_id/path patterns (e.g., "720p" or similar) and is converted to integers when available.
- URL extraction for embedding:
  - _extract_urls() uses a regex to find iframe embeds with a src pointing to media.joj.sk/embed/â€¦, returning all discovered URLs for further processing.

What this achieves
- Enables youtube-dl to download JOJ videos by:
  - Recognizing JOJ embed URLs and the joj: scheme
  - Retrieving metadata (title, duration, thumbnail)
  - Building a list of available video formats with qualities (height-based), prioritizing embedded JS-provided formats and falling back to an XML-based playlist when necessary.
