- Purpose: A YouTube-DL extractor for Clippit (clippituser.tv). It parses a video page at /c/<id> and returns metadata and available video formats.

- Class and base:
  - ClippitIE(InfoExtractor): Implements the extraction logic by overriding _real_extract.

- URL pattern:
  - _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\.)?clippituser\.tv/c/(?P<id>[a-z]+)'
  - Extracts the video_id from the URL as the page identifier.

- Testing data:
  - _TEST provides a sample URL, expected md5 for the MP4, and an info_dict with id, ext, title, uploader, uploader_url, timestamp, upload_date, description, and thumbnail.

- Main functionality (_real_extract):
  - Fetches the HTML page: webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id)
  - Extracts title from the page via HTML <title> tag.
  - Formats extraction:
    - Considers two formats: 'sd' and 'hd'.
    - For each format_id, reads the corresponding data-%s-file attribute (data-sd-file and data-hd-file) from the page.
    - If a format URL is found, extracts height from the URL path using a regex /(?P<height>\d+)\.mp4.
    - Builds a format entry with:
      - url: the media URL
      - format_id: 'sd' or 'hd'
      - quality: determined by qualities(FORMATS)
      - height: integer height if parsed, else None
  - Uploader details:
    - Tries to extract uploader name from a pattern matching a tag with class="username".
    - Constructs uploader_url as https://www.clippituser.tv/p/<uploader> if present, otherwise None.
  - Timestamp:
    - Extracts a datetime attribute and converts it with parse_iso8601; otherwise None.
  - Thumbnail:
    - Extracts a thumbnail URL from data-image attribute.
  - Description:
    - Uses _og_search_description(webpage) as the description (Open Graph fallback).

- Returned information:
  - id: video_id
  - title: extracted from the page
  - formats: list of available formats with url, format_id, quality, and height
  - uploader: uploader name (if found)
  - uploader_url: uploader page URL (if found)
  - timestamp: Unix timestamp parsed from datetime attribute (or None)
  - description: Open Graph description
  - thumbnail: thumbnail URL (if found)

- Implementation details:
  - Uses _html_search_regex for parsing HTML attributes (data-*-file, datetime, data-image, class="username" pattern).
  - Uses _og_search_description for robust description extraction.
  - Relies on the qualities function to rank 'sd' vs 'hd' formats.
  - Gracefully handles missing format URLs or fields by skipping or returning None where appropriate.

Overall, the extractor retrieves two possible video formats from Clippit pages, along with metadata (title, uploader, timestamp, description, thumbnail), assembling a standard video information dictionary for youtube-dl.
