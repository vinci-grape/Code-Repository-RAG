concise summary

- Purpose: A youtube-dl extractor for CMT (cmt.com) video pages. It parses CMT video/show/episode pages and rewrites them to the corresponding MTVN embed URL for downloading.

- Class and inheritance:
  - Class: CMTIE
  - Inherits: MTVIE (uses MTV-related parsing/helpers)

- Key attributes:
  - IE_NAME = 'cmt.com'
  - _VALID_URL: Regular expression matching CMT URLs for videos, shows, full/episodes, and video-clips. Captures the internal id as group 'id'.

- Tests:
  - _TESTS includes several sample URLs with expected MD5s and info_dict data (id, ext, title, description, and optional timestamp/upload_date). Some entries are marked to skip if the video is not available. Also includes a few “only_matching” cases to ensure URL recognition without full extraction.

- Core functionality:
  - _extract_mgid(self, webpage):
    - Tries to extract the mgid (Media GUID) from the page using the pattern:
      MTVN.VIDEO.contentUri = '...mgid...'
    - Uses _search_regex to capture the mgid (group 'mgid').
    - If not found, falls back to _extract_triforce_mgid(webpage) (a helper likely provided by the parent class to extract mgid via another site-specific mechanism).
    - Returns the mgid or None.

  - _real_extract(self, url):
    - Extracts video_id via self._match_id(url).
    - Downloads the webpage: self._download_webpage(url, video_id).
    - Obtains mgid by calling _extract_mgid(webpage).
    - Returns a result pointing to the MTVN embed URL: http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/{mgid}

- Important implementation details:
  - The extractor does not directly download the video file; instead, it derives an MTVN embed URL using the mgid and delegates downstream handling to fetch the embedded content.
  - The mgid extraction has a primary method (contentUri in MTVN.VIDEO) and a fallback (triforce mgid) to maximize reliability across page variants.
  - The _VALID_URL and tests indicate support for multiple CMT page types, but actual video retrieval ultimately routes through the MTVN embed service.

In short: CMTIE extracts a Media GUID from CMT pages and rewrites the URL to MTVN’s embed endpoint for that mgid, leveraging MTVIE helpers and fallback mgid extraction when needed.
