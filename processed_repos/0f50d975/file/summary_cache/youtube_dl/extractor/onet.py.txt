Here is a concise, functionality-focused summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/extractor/onet.py.

Main purpose
- Implement multiple extractors for the Onet family of Polish video sites (onet.tv, onet100.vod.pl, and related domains) to fetch video metadata and available formats, and to build playlists for channels.

Key classes and their roles
- OnetBaseIE (InfoExtractor)
  - Shared base for Onet extractors.
  - _URL_BASE_RE: URL base pattern for Onet domains (onet.tv or onet100.vod.pl).
  - _search_mvp_id(webpage): Extracts an MVP ID from a webpage using the pattern id="mvp:<id>".
  - _extract_from_id(video_id, webpage=None): Core logic to fetch video metadata/formats via an API and return a standard info dict.
    - Calls the API at http://qi.ckm.onetapi.pl/ with a JSON-RPC-like payload to get asset details (body[method]=get_asset_detail, etc.).
    - Handles API errors by raising ExtractorError with the API-provided message.
    - Iterates over video['formats'] to build a list of formats:
      - ism... formats -> extract via _extract_ism_formats
      - mpd (dash) -> _extract_mpd_formats
      - hls... formats -> _extract_m3u8_formats
      - Other HTTP formats: assemble a format dict with url, format_id, audio bitrate (abr), and video properties (height, width, vbr). Distinguishes audio vs video via format_type.
    - Sorts formats with _sort_formats.
    - Metadata: tries og:title/og:description from the page if available, otherwise uses meta['title'] / meta.get('description').
    - duration from meta['length'] or meta['lenght'] (note the typo is accounted for).
    - timestamp parsed from meta['addDate'] via parse_iso8601.
    - Returns a dict with id, title, description, duration, timestamp, formats.

- OnetMVPIE
  - _VALID_URL = onetmvp:(<id>), where id is a digit sequence with decimal (e.g., 381027.1509591944).
  - _real_extract(url): delegates to _extract_from_id(self._match_id(url)) to fetch MVP-based video details.

- OnetIE
  - _VALID_URL = OnetBaseIE._URL_BASE_RE + [path] capturing display_id and id.
  - IE_NAME = 'onet.tv'
  - _real_extract(url):
    - Extracts display_id and video_id from URL.
    - Downloads the page and extracts mvp_id via _search_mvp_id(webpage).
    - Uses _extract_from_id(mvp_id, webpage) to get the video info.
    - Inserts id (video_id) and display_id into the resulting info dict and returns it.

- OnetChannelIE
  - _VALID_URL = OnetBaseIE._URL_BASE_RE + (?P<id>[a-z]+) (channel per slug)
  - IE_NAME = 'onet.tv:channel'
  - _real_extract(url):
    - channel_id = matched slug.
    - Downloads channel page.
    - Parses currentClip data (JSON) embedded in the page to get ckmId and URL for the current video.
    - video_id = remove the 'mvp:' prefix from ckmId.
    - video_name = basename of the current video URL.
    - If --no-playlist, fetch just that video via _extract_from_id(video_id, webpage).
    - Otherwise:
      - Find additional video links on the channel page (regex capturing onetmvp-like paths).
      - Build a list of entries using OnetIE as the extractor for each video link.
      - Extract channel metadata: title and description from elements with classes o_channelName / o_channelDesc.
      - Return a playlist_result with entries, channel_id, channel_title, channel_description.

- OnetPlIE
  - _VALID_URL matches several Polish Onet domains (onet.pl, businessinsider.pl, plejada.pl) with a path that ends in an id.
  - IE_NAME = 'onet.pl'
  - _search_mvp_id(webpage, default=NO_DEFAULT): Looks for data-(params-)?mvp="id" in the page.
  - _real_extract(url):
    - video_id = matched id from URL.
    - Download the page and try to find mvp_id via _search_mvp_id(webpage, default=None).
    - If not found, try fallback: extract a PulseMbed embed URL, download that, and search for mvp id again.
    - Return a URL result pointing to the MVP-based extractor: 'onetmvp:<mvp_id>' with OnetMVPIE as the extractor and video_id set to mvp_id.
  - This handles embedded or across-domain cases (PulseMbed) to obtain the MVP ID.

Important implementation details
- Formats handling:
  - Supports multiple formats depending on the type and provider:
    - isms (ISM) via _extract_ism_formats
    - MPD/DASH via _extract_mpd_formats
    - HLS via _extract_m3u8_formats
    - Direct HTTP(S) progressive streams with metadata: format_id, audio bitrate (abr), and for video: height, width, vbr. Audio-only formats get vcodec='none'.
- Metadata extraction:
  - Uses OpenGraph (og) helpers when a webpage is available, otherwise relies on meta fields in the API response.
  - duration retrieved from meta['length'] or meta['lenght'] (to accommodate a known typo).
  - addDate parsed with parse_iso8601 to produce a timestamp.
- MVP-based flow:
  - The core data source for actual assets appears to be an MVP system. The code extracts mvp IDs from pages, then fetches asset details via a JSON-RPC-like call to http://qi.ckm.onetapi.pl/.
- Channel and playlist handling:
  - Channel pages can yield multiple video entries; the code constructs a playlist_result with channel metadata and a list of video entries. If no-playlist is requested, it falls back to single-video extraction.
- Fallbacks and edge cases:
  - OnetPlIE covers fallback to Pulsembed if a direct MVP ID isnâ€™t present in the page.
  - Robust handling of various URL forms and domain variants (onet.tv, onet100.vod.pl, businessinsider.pl, plejada.pl, Eurosport subpath, etc.).
- Tests:
  - The file includes _TEST entries for several extractors to verify behavior (e.g., sample Onet.tv video, channel, and MVP URL).
  
In short
- This file provides a cohesive set of extractors for Onet video content: a shared base (OnetBaseIE) that fetches and decodes MVP-asset data, plus specialized extractors for MVP URLs (OnetMVPIE), standard Onet pages (OnetIE), channels (OnetChannelIE), and Polish Onet domain pages (OnetPlIE) with a PulseMbed fallback. It handles a variety of format types (ISM, MPD/DASH, HLS, and progressive HTTP), extracts rich metadata, and supports both single-video and playlist-fetching workflows.
