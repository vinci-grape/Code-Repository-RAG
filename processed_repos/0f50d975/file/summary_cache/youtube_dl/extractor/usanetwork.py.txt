- Purpose: Implement a YouTube-DL extractor for USA Network video pages by leveraging the NBCUniversal family extractor (NBCIE).

- Class and inheritance:
  - USANetworkIE(NBCIE): Subclasses NBCIE to reuse NBC-specific video extraction logic.

- URL matching:
  - _VALID_URL uses a regex to identify USA Network video pages and capture the video id.
  - Pattern extracts the id from URLs like https://www.usanetwork.com/.../video/.../1234567.
  - The captured groups include:
    - permalink: the full URL portion after the scheme
    - id: numeric video identifier used by the extractor

- Tests:
  - _TESTS contains one test case for a sample URL: 
    https://www.usanetwork.com/peacock-trailers/video/intelligence-trailer/4185302
  - Expected info_dict:
    - id: '4185302'
    - ext: 'mp4'
    - title: 'Intelligence (Trailer)'
    - description: 'A maverick NSA agent enlists the help of a junior systems analyst in a workplace power grab.'
    - upload_date: '20200715'
    - timestamp: 1594785600
    - uploader: 'NBCU-MPAT'
  - params: {'skip_download': True} to avoid actual download during tests
  - Indicates support for m3u8/mp4 download paths (the test notes m3u8 download path)

- Main functionality:
  - Does not define its own _real_extract logic; relies on NBCIE’s implementation to fetch and parse video metadata from NBCUniversal pages.
  - The URL pattern and inherited behavior enable extraction of standard video metadata (title, description, upload date, uploader, etc.) and the appropriate file extension (mp4, typically via m3u8 or direct mp4).

- Key implementation details:
  - Keeps the extraction tightly coupled with NBC’s metadata structure by subclassing NBCIE, ensuring consistent handling across NBCUniversal properties.
  - The id extracted from the URL is used by NBCIE to locate and fetch the video resource.
