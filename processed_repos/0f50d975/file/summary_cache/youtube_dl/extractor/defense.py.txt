- Purpose: A youtube-dl extractor for videos on defense.gouv.fr.

- Class and inheritance:
  - DefenseGouvFrIE inherits from InfoExtractor.
  - IE_NAME: 'defense.gouv.fr'.

- URL matching:
  - _VALID_URL matches pages under defense.gouv.fr with the path /layout/set/ligthboxvideo/base-de-medias/webtv/ followed by an id slug.
  - The id captured by the URL is used as the video title/key.

- Testing:
  - _TEST provides a sample URL, the expected md5 of the downloaded mp4, and the expected info_dict (id, ext, title).

- Extraction workflow (_real_extract):
  - Derives title from the URL using _match_id(url) (the slug after the last slash).
  - Downloads the webpage content.
  - Extracts a numeric video_id from the page via regex: flashvars.pvg_id="(\d+)".
  - Constructs a JSON config URL:
    http://static.videos.gouv.fr/brightcovehub/export/json/{video_id}
  - Downloads the JSON configuration.
  - Reads the first rendition URL from info['renditions'][0]['url'].
  - Returns an info dict with:
    - id: video_id
    - ext: 'mp4'
    - url: video_url (from the JSON renditions)
    - title: title (the slug from the URL)

- Key implementation details:
  - Uses standard InfoExtractor helpers: _download_webpage, _search_regex, _download_json.
  - Assumes the video URL is the first rendition in the JSON config.
  - Uses HTTP endpoints (no HTTPS in json URL).
  - Title is derived from the URL slug, not from the page content.
