Concise summary:

Purpose
- A Youtube-DL postprocessor that extracts metadata fields from a video title using a user-supplied title format string (e.g., "%(title)s - %(artist)s").

Key class
- MetadataFromTitlePP(PostProcessor)
  - __init__(downloader, titleformat)
    - Stores the title format.
    - Builds a regular expression to parse titles:
      - If the format contains placeholders like %(name)s, it is converted to a regex via format_to_regex.
      - Otherwise, the provided titleformat is treated as the regex itself.
  - format_to_regex(fmt)
    - Converts a format string with %(name)s tokens into a regex with named capture groups (?P<name>.+).
    - Escapes all literal parts of the format and replaces each token with a corresponding named group.
    - Handles trailing literal parts after the last token.
  - run(info)
    - Reads info['title'] and attempts to match it against the prepared regex.
    - If no match, logs a failure message and returns ([], info).
    - If a match, iterates over captured groups and for each non-None value:
      - Adds/overwrites info[attribute] = value.
      - Logs the parsed attribute and value.
    - Returns ([], info) with the new metadata injected into the info dictionary.

Implementation details
- Inherits from PostProcessor and uses the downloader's to_screen for logging.
- Uses re.finditer to locate placeholders in the format string and builds the regex by escaping non-placeholder parts and inserting named groups (?P<name>.+).
- The run method only updates info for non-None captured values.
- Unicode support is ensured via from __future__ import unicode_literals.
- Relies on Python’s re.match (anchored at start) and the constructed regex to align with the title format.

Usage notes
- Typical title format: "%(title)s - %(artist)s", which will populate info['title'] and info['artist'] from the video title.
- If the title doesn’t match the format, the postprocessor logs a message and leaves info unchanged besides the failure notice.

Output behavior
- Returns ([], info) after processing, allowing continuation with other postprocessors and updated metadata in the info dict.
