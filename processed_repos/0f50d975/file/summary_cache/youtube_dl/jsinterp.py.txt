Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/youtube_dl/jsinterp.py

Purpose
- Implements a self-contained JavaScript interpreter used by youtube-dl to evaluate a subset of JS found in target pages (e.g., to extract tokens/signatures). It can parse and execute JS-like expressions, objects, arrays, functions, and several standard built-ins (Date, RegExp, String/Math/Array helpers).

Main functionality
- Evaluate JavaScript expressions and statements in Python without a real JS engine.
- Extract and wrap JavaScript functions/objects from JS source into Python-callable objects.
- Support a limited runtime environment with scoped variables, function calls, control flow, object/array literals, and basic built-ins.

Key classes and components
- function_with_repr
  - Lightweight wrapper that delegates to a Python function but carries a custom __repr__ (used to present JS-side functions as F<index> style).
- JS_Undefined, _NaN, _Infinity
  - Sentinel values mirroring JavaScript concepts (undefined, NaN, Infinity).
- _js_bit_op, _js_arith_op, _js_add, _js_mod, __js_exp, _js_exp, _js_toString, _js_to_primitive
  - Core arithmetic and coercion operators emulating JavaScript semantics (including 32-bit unsigned for bit ops, NaN propagation, ToString/ToPrimitive rules, etc.).
- _js_eq, _js_neq, _js_id_op, _js_comp_op, _js_ternary, _js_unary_op, _js_typeof
  - Implement JavaScript equality (==, ===), inequality, relational ops, ternary operator, unary ops, and typeof.
- Operator tables
  - _OPERATORS, _LOG_OPERATORS, _SC_OPERATORS define operator sets with precedence (tightest first).
  - _OPERATOR_RE, _NAME_RE, _MATCHING_PARENS, _QUOTES, _NESTED_BRACKETS for parsing.
- LocalNameSpace
  - A chain-map-like scope container with special undefined lookup behavior and non-deletable bindings.
- Debugger
  - Optional debugging/logging wrapper; can wrap interpreter methods to print statements and results.
- JSInterpreter
  - Core engine class containing:
  - Inner JS_Object hierarchy: JS_Object (base), JS_RegExp (regex wrapper with flag handling and lazy instantiation), JS_Date (Date emulation with parse/UTC/now/from string).
  - _named_object, _separate, _separate_at_paren, _separate_at_op, _all_operators
    - Helpers for tokenization and parsing expressions and statements, handling quotes, comments, nested structures, and operator precedence.
  - interpret_statement, interpret_expression, interpret_iter
    - The main interpreter loop:
    - Handles: variable declarations (var/const/let), return/throw, new Date/RegExp/Error, object/array literals, unary/binary operators, property access and indexing, function calls, string/array methods, control flow (if/else, for/while/switch/try-catch-finally), and comma expressions.
    - supports short-circuiting, nullish coalescing (??), and a limited form of prototype handling.
  - extract_object(objname, ...): parses the JS code to locate an object with the given name and extracts its functions, wrapping them as Python-callable function_with_repr objects.
  - extract_function_code, extract_function, extract_function_from_code
    - Resolve a JS function by name, returning a Python function wrapper that, when called, interprets the function body in a constructed scope.
  - build_function(argnames, code, *global_stack)
    - Builds a Python callable that executes JS code with a given argument list and an initial global scope. It uses LocalNameSpace to manage variables and supports recursive calls into the interpreter.
  - build_arglist, call_function
    - Helpers to parse function argument lists and to invoke extracted functions with arguments and a global variable map.
  - Supported JS features (subset)
    - Date, RegExp constructors, basic object and array literals, function definitions, property access (dot and bracket notation), array methods (split, join, reverse, slice, splice, shift, pop, unshift, push, forEach, indexOf, charCodeAt, replace/replaceAll), string methods, Math/String/Array/Date-like behavior, and a basic form of error handling (throw/catch/finally).
  - Caching and symbol management
    - Functions and objects extracted from code are cached (_functions) and assigned unique Python-side representations for reuse.
  - Error handling
    - Custom JS_Throw and JSInterpreter.Exception to surface and annotate errors during interpretation, including expression context.

Important implementation details
- Semantics fidelity
  - Emulates JavaScript type coercions and operations (ToNumber, ToString, ToPrimitive, NaN propagation, 32-bit unsigned arithmetic for bitwise ops, 0-division to Infinity behavior, undefined/null handling, and strict vs loose equality rules approximated via _js_eq/_js_neq and related helpers).
- Tokenization and parsing
  - Uses robust string parsing to split expressions by commas or operators while respecting quotes, comments, and nested parentheses/brackets/braces. Handles top-level vs nested separation with _separate and _separate_at_paren.
- RegExp and Date emulation
  - JS_RegExp class: handles JS-like regex flags, lazy compilation, and exposes common regex methods to the interpreter.
  - JS_Date class: supports UTC construction, parsing, now(), toString, and valueOf, bridging JS Date semantics to Python time.
- Function extraction and binding
  - extract_object reads JS source to locate object literals and their function definitions, wrapping each in function_with_repr. extract_function_code and extract_function_from_code rebuild nested functions to enable closures and scoping.
- Proxies and prototypes
  - Minimal support for Function.prototype.call/apply and prototype interactions during member resolution.
- Debug and tracing
  - Debugger.wrap_interpreter optionally logs the evaluation trace, useful for debugging complex JS interactions embedded in pages.
- Performance notes
  - This is a large, handcrafted interpreter tailored to the subset of JavaScript used by YouTube pages. It’s not a general-purpose JS engine and has many edge-case approximations. It’s designed for correctness and compatibility in the contexts youtube-dl encounters, with caching to avoid repeated parsing of same functions.

In short
- This file provides a self-contained, Python-based JavaScript interpreter specialized for youtube-dl. It includes numeric and string coercion, comparisons, logical and ternary operators, Date/RegExp emulation, object/array handling, a partial JS standard library surface, and a mechanism to extract and execute JS functions defined in the loaded code. It relies on a combination of tokenization, recursive descent-like evaluation, and object binding to emulate a functional subset of JavaScript within Python.
