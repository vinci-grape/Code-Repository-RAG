Concise summary of the code file

Purpose
- This is a unit test module for the YoutubeDLCookieJar class from youtube_dl.utils. It verifies loading, saving, and querying cookies from various test data files.

Key components
- TestYoutubeDLCookieJar(unittest.TestCase): Test suite containing five tests focused on cookie loading, persistence, and retrieval behaviors.

Tests and what they validate
1) test_keep_session_cookies
- Loads session cookies from test/testdata/cookies/session_cookies.txt.
- Saves cookies to a temporary file.
- Reads the saved content and asserts it contains two specific cookie entries:
  - Domain www.foobar.foobar, path /, with attributes including YoutubeDLExpiresEmpty and YoutubeDLExpiresEmptyValue.
  - Domain www.foobar.foobar, path /, with attributes including YoutubeDLExpires0 and YoutubeDLExpires0Value.
- Validates that saving preserves necessary cookie fields for session cookies.

2) test_strip_httponly_prefix
- Loads cookies from test/testdata/cookies/httponly_cookies.txt.
- Checks internal storage (cookiejar._cookies) preserves cookie names with an HTTPONLY-like prefix:
  - Keys 'HTTPONLY_COOKIE' and 'JS_ACCESSIBLE_COOKIE' exist under domain 'www.foobar.foobar' and path '/'.
  - Each cookieâ€™s value equals its key plus '_VALUE' (i.e., 'HTTPONLY_COOKIE_VALUE', 'JS_ACCESSIBLE_COOKIE_VALUE').
- The test name suggests handling of HTTPOnly-prefixed cookie names during loading.

3) test_malformed_cookies
- Loads cookies from test/testdata/cookies/malformed_cookies.txt.
- Expects no cookies to be loaded (cookiejar._cookies is empty), indicating malformed entries are ignored gracefully.

4) test_get_cookie_header
- Loads cookies from test/testdata/cookies/httponly_cookies.txt.
- Calls get_cookie_header('https://www.foobar.foobar') and asserts the resulting header contains 'HTTPONLY_COOKIE'.
- Verifies that cookies contribute to proper Cookie header construction for a URL.

5) test_get_cookies_for_url
- Loads cookies from test/testdata/cookies/session_cookies.txt.
- Calls get_cookies_for_url('https://www.foobar.foobar/') and expects exactly 2 cookies.
- Calls get_cookies_for_url('https://foobar.foobar/') and expects no cookies (demonstrates URL host/path matching behavior).

Implementation details
- The tests import YoutubeDLCookieJar from youtube_dl.utils after adjusting sys.path to include the repo root.
- They use direct access to the internal structure cookiejar._cookies to inspect domains, paths, and cookie entries, demonstrating internal cookie storage shape.
- They invoke:
  - load(ignore_discard=True, ignore_expires=True)
  - save(filename=..., ignore_discard=True, ignore_expires=True)
  - get_cookie_header(url)
  - get_cookies_for_url(url)
- Test data files are located under test/testdata/cookies/ and cover normal, httponly-prefixed, and malformed cookie scenarios.

Execution
- The file ends with the standard unittest.main() invocation under the main guard, enabling direct execution as a test script.

Overall
- The suite confirms that YoutubeDLCookieJar can:
  - Load cookies from various Netscape/Mozilla-style files, including those with HTTPOnly-style prefixes.
  - Ignore malformed entries without crashing.
  - Preserve cookies when saving to a file with proper formatting.
  - Retrieve appropriate cookies for a given URL and construct cookie headers correctly.
