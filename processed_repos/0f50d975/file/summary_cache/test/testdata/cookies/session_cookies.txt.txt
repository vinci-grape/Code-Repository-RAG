This is not executable code but a test data fixture: a Netscape-format cookie file used by youtube-dl tests.

Key details:
- Location: ./youtube-dl/test/testdata/cookies/session_cookies.txt
- Purpose: Provides sample cookies for tests (loading into a cookie jar, verifying parsing, expiration handling, and secure flags).
- Format: Netscape HTTP Cookie File
  - Each non-comment line is a cookie record with fields separated by tabs:
    - domain
    - flag (TRUE/FALSE) indicating whether subdomains are included (TRUE) or only exact domain matches (FALSE)
    - path
    - secure (TRUE/FALSE) indicating if the cookie is secure
    - expires (Unix epoch timestamp; empty means a session cookie)
    - name
    - value
  - Comment lines begin with # and note the Netscape cookie format and that the file is generated.
- Cookies contained:
  - Cookie 1:
    - domain: www.foobar.foobar
    - flag: FALSE (host-only; exact domain)
    - path: /
    - secure: TRUE
    - expires: (empty) -> session cookie
    - name: YoutubeDLExpiresEmpty
    - value: YoutubeDLExpiresEmptyValue
  - Cookie 2:
    - domain: www.foobar.foobar
    - flag: FALSE
    - path: /
    - secure: TRUE
    - expires: 0 -> treated as expired in many parsers
    - name: YoutubeDLExpires0
    - value: YoutubeDLExpires0Value

Important implications:
- The first cookie tests handling of a session cookie (no expiration).
- The second cookie tests handling of an already-expired cookie (expires = 0).
- Both cookies are marked secure and domain-matched to the given domain, with host-only scope (FLAG FALSE).

Overall, this file serves as a lightweight fixture to validate cookie loading, expiration logic, and secure-flag handling in youtube-dlâ€™s test suite.
