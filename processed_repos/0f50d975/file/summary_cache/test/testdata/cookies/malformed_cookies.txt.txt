Summary:

- Type: Data/test fixture file (not executable code) used by youtube-dl’s test suite.
- Purpose: Provide input for testing a Netscape-style HTTP cookie file parser, specifically to exercise handling of malformed cookie entries.
- Location: ./youtube-dl/test/testdata/cookies/malformed_cookies.txt

Key contents and what they represent:

- Header lines:
  - "# Netscape HTTP Cookie File"
  - "# http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html"
  - "# This is a generated file!  Do not edit."
  These indicate the Netscape cookie file format and that the file is a generated test artifact.

- Two intentionally malformed cookie entries (to test parser robustness):
  1) Malformed due to invalid number of fields:
     - Line: www.foobar.foobar\tFALSE\t/\tFALSE\t0\tCOOKIE
     - Interpretation: This line has only 6 fields (domain, flag, path, secure, expiration, name) and is missing the 7th field (value). The comment explicitly notes “invalid number of fields - 6 instead of 7.”
  2) Malformed due to invalid expiration value:
     - Line: www.foobar.foobar\tFALSE\t/\tFALSE\t1.7976931348623157e+308\tCOOKIE\tVALUE
     - Interpretation: This line has 7 fields (domain, flag, path, secure, expiration, name, value) but the expiration value is an unrealistically large number (near the IEEE 754 double max). The comment notes “invalid expires at.”

Implementation details:

- Field format follows the Netscape cookie file convention: fields are tab-separated in the order:
  domain, flag, path, secure, expiration, name, value
- Comment lines starting with # are ignored by parsers.
- The first malformed line omits the value, testing whether the parser correctly rejects lines with too few fields.
- The second malformed line includes a value but uses an expiration timestamp that is not a valid Unix epoch timestamp, testing whether the parser rejects or handles invalid date values gracefully.

Overall purpose:

- Serve as a robust test dataset to verify that cookie parsing code in youtube-dl can:
  - Detect and ignore (or error on) lines with an incorrect field count.
  - Detect and handle (reject or sanitize) cookies with invalid expiration values.
  - Ignore comment lines and continue parsing valid entries (if any exist in the real dataset).

There are no functions or classes in this file; it is purely a fixture for tests.
