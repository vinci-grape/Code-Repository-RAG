- Purpose: A unit test for YouTube-DL’s IQIYI extractor login flow, specifically testing how the SDK interpreter handles login using mocked credentials.

- Key components:
  - IqiyiIEWithCredentials(IqiyiIE): A test subclass that overrides _get_login_info to return fixed credentials ('foo', 'bar').
  - WarningLogger: Simple logger capturing warning messages in self.messages; debug and error methods are no-ops.
  - TestIqiyiSDKInterpreter (unittest.TestCase):
    - test_iqiyi_sdk_interpreter: Sets up a FakeYDL downloader with the WarningLogger, constructs IqiyiIEWithCredentials, calls _login(), and asserts that a warning message containing 'unable to log in:' was logged (specifically as the first message).

- Important implementation details:
  - sys.path adjustment at the top ensures the test can import project modules.
  - _get_login_info is overridden to simulate credential retrieval during login.
  - The test uses FakeYDL({'logger': logger}) to ensure the extractor uses the provided logger.
  - The assertion checks the first logged message includes the substring 'unable to log in:', verifying the login failure path is correctly reported.
  - The test docstring notes that if the sign is incorrect, the /validate HTTP call would raise an HTTP 556 error, which this test indirectly checks via logging.
  - The file ends with the standard unittest.main() invocation when run as a script.

- Overall: Verifies that the IQiyi extractor’s login flow, given mocked credentials, logs an appropriate warning on login failure.
