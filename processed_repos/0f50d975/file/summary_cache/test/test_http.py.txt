Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/test/test_http.py

Purpose
- A comprehensive test suite for youtube-dl’s HTTP client behavior. It spins up local HTTP/HTTPS servers and proxy servers to simulate real-world HTTP interactions (redirects, headers, cookies, compression, proxies, file URLs, etc.) and verifies youtube-dl’s handling.

Main components
- HTTPTestRequestHandler (subclass of compat_http_server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler)
  - Implements a versatile test server with endpoints for:
    - /headers: returns request headers as JSON-like payload
    - /video.html, /vid.mp4: simple HTML/MP4 payloads
    - /redirect_*, /302, /308-to-headers, /trailing_garbage, /redirect_dotsegments: various redirect and redirection edge cases
    - /中文.html and other non-ASCII paths: Unicode/percent-encoding handling and redirects
    - /content-encoding: applies requested encodings (gzip, deflate, br, etc.) to a payload; supports multiple encodings and an “unsupported” path
    - /308-to-headers, /headers: cookie handling and header behavior on redirects
    - /trailing_garbage: ensures trailing data after gzip is ignored
  - Compression helpers:
    - gzip_compress: utility to gzip data
  - Header handling:
    - Custom send_header/end_headers logic to allow non-ASCII header values for testing
    - Buffers non-ASCII header lines and flushes at end_headers
  - URL construction helper: _test_url

- TestHTTP (unittest.TestCase)
  - Sets up:
    - HTTP server (127.0.0.1, random port)
    - HTTPS server with test certificate (127.0.0.1, random port)
  - SSL handling:
    - test_nocheckcertificate: validates behavior with/without certificate verification
  - URL formatting and redirects:
    - test_percent_encode: uppercase percent-encoding and preservation of existing encodings
    - test_unicode_path_redirection: non-ASCII redirects to encoded path
    - test_redirect: extensive checks for redirect handling across status codes (303, 301, 302, 307, 308) and methods; verifies method changes, content-type presence/absence, and error behavior for 300/304/305/306
  - Content-type and requests:
    - test_content_type: ensures Content-Type is set for POST/encoded data on both HTTP and HTTPS
    - test_update_req: ensures update_Request converts GET to POST with data and proper handling
  - Cookies:
    - test_cookiejar: cookiejar cookies are sent
    - test_passed_cookie_header: per-request Cookie header override, behavior on redirects, and per-request cookie precedence over global cookiejar
  - Compression (encoded responses):
    - test_no_compression_compat_header: no-compression header in request yields identity encoding
    - test_gzip_trailing_garbage, test_brotli, test_deflate, test_gzip: end-to-end decompression and correctness
    - test_multiple_encodings: RFC 9110 style multiple encodings
    - test_unsupported_encoding: raw content is returned when encoding is unsupported
    - test_remove_dot_segments: normalization of dot segments in redirects
  - Proxy handling:
    - _build_proxy_handler: helper to create simple proxy-like servers
    - TestProxy: tests including geo-verification proxy and IDN handling through a proxy
      - test_proxy: ensures proxy routing works and geo proxy logic is exercised via a header
      - test_proxy_with_idn: IDN domain routing through proxy and punycode normalization
  - File URLs (security constraint):
    - TestFileURL.test_file_urls: file:// URLs are disabled by youtube-dl by default (raises URLError with a specific message); includes commented-out block for a future-enabled scenario
  - Compatibility and environment:
    - Uses YoutubeDL, FakeYDL, and FakeLogger helpers
    - Skips or marks expected failures for platform-specific quirks (e.g., brotli or Jython-related issues)
    - Relies on youtube_dl.compat and youtube_dl.utils for compatibility shims and request utilities

Key implementation details
- Endpoints simulate realistic HTTP scenarios: redirects (including 303/307 semantics), non-ASCII paths, dot-segment handling, 308-to-headers, and content negotiation with multiple encodings.
- Compression handling in tests:
  - /content-encoding applies per-request encodings (gzip, deflate, br) and can combine multiple encodings per RFC order; includes unsupported encoding behavior (returns raw content).
  - Ensures proper decompression and that decoded content matches expectations.
- Header handling for testing:
  - Custom send_header/end_headers path allows including non-ASCII header values to test client handling of such headers.
- SSL tests:
  - Creates a local HTTPS server with a test cert; includes a nocheckcertificate option path to verify certificate-handling logic.
- Cookie tests:
  - Verifies interaction between global cookiejar and per-request Cookie headers, including behavior across redirects (cookies cleared on redirects unless overridden).
- Proxy tests:
  - Local proxy servers simulate normal and geo-verification proxy paths; tests verify that youtube-dl respects proxy settings and header-based proxy overrides; also tests IDN domain handling via proxy.
- File URL test:
  - Confirms that file:// URLs are blocked by default for security reasons, with a clear error message.

Usage intent
- Ensures robust HTTP behavior in youtube-dl across redirects, encodings, cookies, proxy usage, SSL, and edge cases like non-ASCII paths and dot-segments.
- Provides a suite of regression tests to catch regressions in HTTP/URL handling code paths.
