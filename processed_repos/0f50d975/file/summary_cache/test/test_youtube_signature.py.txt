This file is a unit test module for youtube-dl that validates YouTube signature deciphering logic. It covers two main areas: extracting the proper player id from YouTube player URLs, and verifying the signature (sig/nsig) generation by parsing and executing the JavaScript used by YouTube players.

Key components

- _SIG_TESTS and _NSIG_TESTS
  - Lists of test vectors.
  - Each entry for _SIG_TESTS contains (url, sig_input, expected_signature). The tests exercise the signature function produced from the JS code found at the given URL, using either a numeric input (which maps to the first N printable characters) or a direct string input, and verify the resulting signature matches expected_signature.
  - Each entry for _NSIG_TESTS contains (url, sig_input, expected_nsig). These test the non-sig path by extracting and applying the “nsig” function logic to the given input.

- TestPlayerInfo class
  - test_youtube_extract_player_info verifies that YoutubeIE._extract_player_info correctly parses various YouTube player URLs and returns the expected player_id (e.g., 64dddad9, e7567ecf, etc.).
  - Uses a FakeYDL environment to instantiate YoutubeIE.

- TestSignature class
  - setUp creates a testdata/sigs directory to cache downloaded JS files used for signature tests.
  - tearDown cleans up the directory contents after tests.

Dynamic test generation

- t_factory(name, sig_func, url_pattern)
  - Returns a function maker that creates a test function for a given test vector.
  - For each test vector, it downloads the corresponding JS file (if not present) into testdata/sigs, reads the file, and asserts sig_func(jscode, sig_input) == expected_sig.
  - Tests are attached to TestSignature with names like test_signature_js_<id>, built from a URL-derived id.

- make_sig_test and make_nsig_test
  - Build and attach tests for signature and nsig using:
    - make_sig_test on SIG test vectors with a regex that recognizes both html5player and other player JS URLs.
    - make_nsig_test on NSIG test vectors with a simple pattern for player JS URLs.

Core functions under test

- signature(jscode, sig_input)
  - Parses the signing function from the JS code using YoutubeIE._parse_sig_js(jscode).
  - Builds src_sig as either a substring of printable characters (if sig_input is int) or uses sig_input directly.
  - Applies the parsed signing function to src_sig and returns the result.

- n_sig(jscode, sig_input)
  - Uses a JSInterpreter on the provided JS code.
  - Calls YoutubeIE._extract_n_function_code_jsi and _extract_n_function_from_code to obtain the function, then executes it with sig_input to obtain the nsig.

Implementation details

- Uses YoutubeIE with a FakeYDL environment (cachedir: False) to isolate tests from external dependencies.
- JS files are loaded from the internet on-demand and cached locally in testdata/sigs.
- The test URL matching uses two patterns:
  - A regex for signature tests that covers html5player variations and base.js cases.
  - A simple pattern for nsig tests that targets /player/<id>.js URLs.
- After test execution, the tearDown method removes any downloaded JS files to keep the test environment clean.

Overall purpose

- Ensure that both the extraction of the correct YouTube player ID and the complex JavaScript-based signature deciphering logic used by YouTube (and by extension youtube-dl) behave as expected across a wide set of real-world player JS variations. The tests dynamically fetch and validate actual JS code against known correct outputs, providing coverage for evolving YouTube signing schemes.
