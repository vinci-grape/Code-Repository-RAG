Concise summary of the code file

- Purpose: A unit test module for youtube-dl that verifies the ability to extract YouTube video IDs from various URL formats (and directly from an ID string) using the YoutubeIE extractor.

- Main components:
  - Test class: TestYoutubeMisc (subclass of unittest.TestCase)
  - Test method: test_youtube_extract
    - Uses a lambda assertExtractId to compare YoutubeIE.extract_id(url) against the expected id.
    - Validates multiple URL variations that should yield the same video id:
      - http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=BaW_jenozKc
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=BaW_jenozKc
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=BaW_jenozKc
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=BaW_jenozKc
      - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKcsharePLED17F32AD9753930 (trailing junk after id)
      - 'BaW_jenozKc' (direct ID string)
  - Import sources:
    - from youtube_dl.extractor import YoutubeIE
  - Test setup:
    - Path manipulation to ensure youtube_dl.extractor is importable: sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
    - This makes the test runnable within the repository without installation.
  - Execution entry point:
    - if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()

- Key functionality tested:
  - YoutubeIE.extract_id(url) should robustly parse and return the video ID from various YouTube URL shapes and also return the input when given a bare ID string.
  - Ensures compatibility with different query parameter orders and with extraneous trailing characters after the ID in the URL.

- Implementation details:
  - Compatibility: Includes __future__ unicode_literals for Python 2/3 compatibility.
  - Direct execution: The script is designed to be directly runnable as a test module.
  - Test coverage focus: Only exercises the extract_id static method of YoutubeIE, not the full download/extraction workflow.
