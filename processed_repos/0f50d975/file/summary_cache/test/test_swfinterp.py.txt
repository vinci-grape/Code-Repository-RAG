Concise but comprehensive summary

Overview
- This test file dynamically creates and runs unit tests for the SWF interpreter used by youtube-dl.
- It compiles ActionScript tests (.as) to SWF if needed, then runs them through SWFInterpreter and checks the results against expected outputs embedded in the .as files.

Key components
- TestSWFInterpreter (unittest.TestCase): container for dynamically added test methods.
- _make_testfunc(testfile): factory function that builds a test function for a given .as file.
- SWFInterpreter: imported from youtube_dl.swfinterp; used to load and execute SWF content.
- Compilation via mxmlc: if the corresponding .swf is missing or out-of-date relative to the .as file, the test compiles the .as file into a .swf.
- Test data extraction: the .as file must contain lines formatted as // input: <json> and // output: <json>, which are parsed and used as input and expected output for the test.
- Dynamic test discovery: tests are created for every file in the swftests directory with a .as extension.

How it works
- It dynamically inserts the repository root into sys.path to import youtube-dl modules.
- It defines TEST_DIR as the swftests directory adjacent to this file.
- For each .as file in swftests:
  - It creates a test function named test_swf_<test_id>, where test_id is the basename without the .as extension.
  - It checks if a corresponding .swf exists and is up-to-date; if not, it attempts to compile using mxmlc.
  - If mxmlc is not installed, the test is skipped with an explanatory message.
  - It loads the SWF content and instantiates SWFInterpreter with it.
  - It reads the .as file content to extract input and expected output using regex looking for lines like // input: <json> and // output: <json>.
  - It locates the SWF class named after test_id, extracts the main function, invokes it with the parsed input, and asserts that the result equals the parsed output.

Important implementation details
- Test data extraction: _find_spec uses a multi-line regex to locate // key: value lines and json.loads the value.
- File handling: AS files are read with UTF-8 encoding; SWF files are read in binary mode.
- Recompilation logic: SWF is rebuilt if missing or older than the corresponding AS file, ensuring tests run against current code.
- Error handling: If mxmlc is not found (OSError with errno ENOENT), the test is skipped gracefully to avoid false failures.
- Test naming: test function names are normalized to test_swf_<test_id> for clarity in test output.
- Class/function extraction: SWFInterpreter.extract_class(test_id) and extract_function(swf_class, 'main') are used to obtain the callable entry point for the test.
- Environment setup: The code modifies sys.path to ensure the youtube-dl package modules can be imported when running tests from this directory.

Overall purpose
- Provide automated, data-driven tests for the SWF interpreter by compiling ActionScript test cases to SWF, executing them, and verifying output against explicit expectations embedded in the test files.
