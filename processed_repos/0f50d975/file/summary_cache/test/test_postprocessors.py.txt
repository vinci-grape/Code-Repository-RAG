- Purpose: A small unit test file for the postprocessor that extracts metadata from a title string (MetadataFromTitlePP) in youtube-dl.

- Key class/functionality:
  - Tests the MetadataFromTitlePP postprocessor, specifically its ability to generate an internal regular expression from a given title format template.
  - The test focuses on the format string "%(title)s - %(artist)s" and checks the resulting internal regex.

- Test details:
  - test_format_to_regex creates an instance with the format "%(title)s - %(artist)s" (the first constructor argument is None, the second is the format).
  - It asserts that the private attribute _titleregex equals the string:
    (?P<title>.+)\ \-\ (?P<artist>.+)
  - This indicates the postprocessor uses named capture groups 'title' and 'artist' and escapes the dash and spaces in the regex.

- Implementation notes:
  - The test imports MetadataFromTitlePP from youtube_dl.postprocessor.
  - It temporarily adjusts sys.path to include the project root so the module can be imported.
  - The test directly asserts the exact string of the internal regex, implying the _titleregex attribute is a string representing the regex used to parse a title according to the template.

- Overall: The file provides a focused validation that the format-to-regex translation for metadata extraction is implemented correctly, ensuring the parsing of a title like "Title - Artist" yields the expected named groups.
