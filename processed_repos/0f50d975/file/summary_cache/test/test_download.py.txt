Concise but comprehensive summary of youtube-dl/test/test_download.py

Purpose
- Dynamically generate and run a battery of tests for youtube-dl extractors based on test case definitions provided by test.helper.gettestcases().
- Validate both the information extracted (info_dict) and the resulting downloaded files (and associated .info.json) for correctness, including in playlist scenarios.

Key components
- Test class and helpers
  - TestDownload (subclass of unittest.TestCase)
    - Sets up multiprocessing support and a descriptive __str__ for test identification.
    - setUp stores test definitions into self.defs.
  - YoutubeDL (subclass of youtube_dl.YoutubeDL)
    - __init__: aliases to_stderr to to_screen and initializes processed_info_dicts.
    - report_warning: overridden to raise ExtractorError (fail tests on warnings).
    - process_info: records processed info dictionaries and delegates to parent.
  - _file_md5(fn): utility to compute MD5 of a file.
  - _encode_str: ensures proper str type for test environment compatibility.

- Test data and helpers
  - defs = gettestcases(): loads test case definitions from test.helper.
  - Various utilities imported from test.helper: expect_warnings, get_params, gettestcases, expect_info_dict, try_rm, report_warning.

- Dynamic test generation
  - generator(test_case, tname): factory that creates a test method for each test case.
  - For each test_case:
    - Resolves extractor(s) to test (name + optional add_ie dependencies).
    - Determines if the case is a playlist test and prepares test_cases accordingly (playlist vs single video).
    - Validates that each defined info_dict has required keys 'id' and 'ext'.
    - Handles optional 'skip' messages and skips dependent IEs that are not WORKING.
    - Builds parameters via get_params, modifies output template (outtmpl) to be unique per test.
    - For playlists, sets extract_flat, playlistend, and skip_download by default.
    - Creates a YoutubeDL instance (auto_init=False) and registers a progress hook to track finished filenames.
    - Uses expect_warnings to enforce expected warnings for the test_case.
    - Defines get_tc_filename(tc) to compute the expected file path for a test_case.
    - Defines try_rm_tcs_files() to clean up generated files, including .part and .info.json.
    - Attempts extraction with retry logic:
      - Calls ydl.extract_info(test_case['url'], force_generic_extractor=...) and handles certain network-related exceptions (URLError, timeout, UnavailableVideoError, BadStatusLine, or 503 HTTPError with code 503).
      - Retries up to RETRIES times; on final failure, issues a warning and aborts the test.
      - On success, validates results.
    - Playlist validation:
      - Ensures res_dict['_type'] is 'playlist' or 'multi_video' and 'entries' exist.
      - Validates overall info_dict against test_case['info_dict'].
      - Validates playlist min/max/count/duration constraints if provided.
    - Result normalization and per-entry validation:
      - Normalizes to res_dict['entries'] for both single videos and playlists.
      - For each tc in test_cases:
        - Validates per-entry info_dict against tc['info_dict'].
        - Handles dynamic IDs via 're:' placeholders by substituting the actual extracted id and restoring later if needed.
        - Verifies the downloaded file exists and has been recorded in finished_hook_called.
        - Optional size check (min size) and md5 validation if provided.
        - Validates the corresponding .info.json content against tc['info_dict'].
    - Cleanup in finally:
        - Removes generated test files and .info.jsons for all test_cases.
        - If a playlist test returns multiple entries, also removes extra files created by extractors that return full results when extract_flat is used.

- Dynamic test attachment
  - The bottom section iterates over all test_case in defs, creates a unique test method name (test_<name> or test_<name>_<n>), and attaches the generated test method to TestDownload.
  - Each test_method stores its dependencies via add_ie and is added to the TestDownload class.

Important implementation details
- Network resilience: Tests retry up to RETRIES times on common network errors before giving up, to avoid false negatives due to transient issues.
- Warnings handling: test suite converts warnings into ExtractorError (by overriding report_warning), ensuring tests fail if a warning would have been emitted during normal execution.
- Info file verification: For each tested entry, the test compares the in-memory info_dict and also reads the produced .info.json to ensure consistency.
- Playlist handling: Supports both single-video and playlist tests, with specific handling for extract_flat and playlist boundaries (min/max/count/duration).
- Dynamic IDs: Supports tests that use a placeholder 're:' for IDs, validating that IDs can be mapped correctly post-extraction.
- File integrity checks: Optional MD5 checksums and minimum file size checks are supported for downloaded outputs.
- Clean-up: Ensures no test artifacts linger after tests, including for playlist tests which may produce multiple files.

Workflow overview
- Load test cases via gettestcases().
- For each test case, dynamically create a unittest method that:
  - Configures a YoutubeDL instance with test-specific parameters.
  - Executes extraction (with retries) and validates both logical (info dicts) and physical outputs (files and .info.json).
  - Cleans up after itself, including files created during testing.
- Attach all generated tests to TestDownload and run via unittest.main() when executed as a script.

Overall, this file implements a robust, data-driven test suite for youtube-dl extractors, validating both data extraction and file-level outcomes across single videos and playlists, with careful handling of dependencies, warnings, network issues, and cleanup.
