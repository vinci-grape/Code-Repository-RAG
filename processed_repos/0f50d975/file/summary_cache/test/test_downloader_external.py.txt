Concise, comprehensive summary of the code in ./youtube-dl/test/test_downloader_external.py

Purpose
- Implement a suite of unit/integration tests for the external downloaders used by youtube-dl (Aria2cFD, Aria2pFD, AxelFD, CurlFD, FFmpegFD, HttpieFD, WgetFD).
- Verify both command-line construction (for each downloader) and runtime behavior (for at least Aria2pFD and FFmpegFD when available).
- Use a local HTTP server to simulate remote content with various response scenarios (content-length, range requests, etc.) and a cookie handling flow.

Main structure and key components
- Test harness setup
  - Test helpers: FakeLogger, FakeYDL, http_server_port, try_rm from test.helper.
  - youtube-dl imports: YoutubeDL, compat utilities, encoding helpers (encodeFilename, join_nonempty), postprocessor (FFmpegPostProcessor).
  - External downloader classes tested: Aria2cFD, Aria2pFD, AxelFD, CurlFD, FFmpegFD, HttpieFD, WgetFD.
  - Cookie handling: TEST_COOKIE, TEST_COOKIE_VALUE, cookiejar_Cookie helper.

- HTTP server for tests
  - HTTPTestRequestHandler serves test content at several endpoints:
    - /regular: returns content with Content-Length and a full range of payload (size TEST_SIZE).
    - /no-content-length: returns content without Content-Length.
    - /no-range: content supports no Range requests.
    - /no-range-no-content-length: neither Range nor Content-Length is provided.
  - Range handling support via send_content_range to simulate partial content responses.
  - The server runs on a dynamic port in a background thread for each test.

- Availability gating helpers
  - ifExternalFDAvailable(externalFD): skips tests if the named external downloader is not available on the system.
  - ifFFmpegFDAvailable(externalFD): more complex gate that allows running FFmpeg-based tests only if:
    - the external FD is available, and
    - FFmpegPostProcessor.available evaluates to True (best-effort via suppressing exceptions).

Test classes and their focus

- TestAria2pFD (skipped unless Aria2pFD is available)
  - setUp: spins up the local HTTP server.
  - download(params, ep): starts aria2c --enable-rpc in a subprocess, runs YoutubeDL with given params, downloads a single endpoint, and asserts:
    - exit code 0
    - downloaded file size equals TEST_SIZE
  - download_all(params): iterates over endpoints: regular, no-content-length, no-range, no-range-no-content-length.
  - test_regular: uses external_downloader = 'aria2p'.
  - test_chunked: same as above but with http_chunk_size = 1000 to exercise chunked downloading.

- TestHttpieFD (requires HttpieFD)
  - test_make_cmd: verifies HttpieFD._make_cmd generates a proper curl-like command:
    - Basic case: ['http', '--download', '--output', 'test', 'http://www.example.com/']
    - With cookies: when a cookie is present in ydl.cookiejar, command includes 'Cookie:<cookie-header>'.

- TestAxelFD (requires AxelFD)
  - test_make_cmd: validates Axel command construction:
    - Basic case: ['axel', '-o', 'test', '--', 'http://www.example.com/']
    - With cookies: includes '-H', 'Cookie: <cookie-header>', and adds '--max-redirect=0' before the URL.

- TestWgetFD (requires WgetFD)
  - test_make_cmd: asserts:
    - Initial command does not include --load-cookies.
    - After setting a cookie, the command includes --load-cookies (cookie jar file path embedded by the downloader).

- TestCurlFD (requires CurlFD)
  - test_make_cmd: asserts:
    - Initial command does not include --cookie.
    - After setting a cookie, the command includes --cookie and the cookie value.

- TestAria2cFD (requires Aria2cFD)
  - test_make_cmd: confirms that:
    - Before cookies are set, there is no _cookies_tempfile attribute yet.
    - After adding a cookie, the constructed command includes --load-cookies=<path-to-tempfile> which is produced by the downloader.

- TestFFmpegFD (requires FFmpegFD, conditionally skipped)
  - Uses a helper to determine availability: only runs if FFmpeg is effectively available or detectable via FFmpegPostProcessor.available.
  - test_make_cmd:
    - Uses a FakeYDL instance and a test hook _debug_cmd to capture the FFmpeg command.
    - For info with ext='mp4', invoking _call_downloader should produce an FFmpeg invocation like:
      ffmpeg -y -i http://www.example.com/ -c copy -f mp4 file:test
    - When cookies are present, FFmpeg command includes -cookies followed by the properly formatted cookie header string (TEST_COOKIE_VALUE plus cookie attributes and carriage return line feed).

Implementation details and notable behavior
- Cookie handling and header formatting
  - Cookies are created using compat_http_cookiejar_Cookie and converted to a header string with the test helper TEST_COOKIE_VALUE.
  - Different downloaders include cookies in different ways:
    - HttpieFD: header value appended directly as 'Cookie:<cookie-value>'.
    - AxelFD: uses -H 'Cookie: <cookie-value>' and includes a redirect limit.
    - WgetFD: uses a cookies file via --load-cookies after a cookie is set.
    - CurlFD: uses --cookie '<cookie-header>'.
    - Aria2cFD: uses a temporary file referenced by --load-cookies.
    - FFmpegFD: uses -cookies '<cookie-header>' with the exact formatting including path/domain; includes CRLF sequence as part of header string.
- Command construction validation
  - Each external downloader class exposes a _make_cmd method (or equivalent) used to build the system command for download; tests explicitly assert the exact sequence of tokens, ensuring correct integration with youtube-dl’s cookie handling and URL.
- HTTP server behavior coverage
  - The server’s various endpoints test different real-world scenarios:
    - Regular download with Content-Length (normal path).
    - Download without Content-Length (chunked or unknown size scenarios).
    - Server that does not support Range requests (for tests that rely on chunked behavior).
    - End-to-end download tests (Aria2pFD) exercise actual data transfer against these endpoints.
- FFmpeg-specific gating
  - The test suite includes a sophisticated gating function for FFmpeg-based tests to avoid false negatives when FFmpeg isn’t installed. It leverages FFmpegPostProcessor.available when possible, otherwise falls back to availability checks.
- Test execution
  - The module ends with the standard unittest.main() guard to run tests when executed as a script.

Overall summary
- This test file provides comprehensive coverage for external downloaders integrated with youtube-dl. It validates:
  - Correct command-line construction for multiple external downloaders, including proper cookie header handling.
  - Cookie propagation across different tools (Httpie, Axel, Wget, Curl, Aria2c) and FFmpeg, with attention to nuanced header formatting.
  - Integration test for aria2p by spinning up a local HTTP server that emulates a real download scenario and verifying file size after download.
  - Conditional execution based on the availability of external tools and FFmpeg, to ensure tests run in diverse environments without false failures.
- The tests rely on a local HTTP server simulating content with and without Content-Length, with and without Range support, to exercise the downloader logic under realistic conditions.
