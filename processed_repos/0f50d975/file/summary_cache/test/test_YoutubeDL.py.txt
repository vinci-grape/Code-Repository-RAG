Concise but comprehensive summary of ./youtube-dl/test/test_YoutubeDL.py

Overview
- A large suite of unit tests for youtube-dl, focusing on:
  - Format selection and filtering logic
  - Subtitles and automatic captions handling
  - Filename templating and default format specs
  - Post-processing integration
  - Match-filter and playlist item selection
  - Cookie handling (including header cookies and info.json cookies)
  - URL handling interactions with extractors (including url_transparent)
  - Miscellaneous utility behavior (default times, error conditions, etc.)
- Uses a test double YDL (class YDL) that extends FakeYDL to capture processed info rather than performing real downloads.
- Builds fake InfoDict structures via a helper _make_result(formats, **kwargs) to exercise format lists.

Key classes, helpers, and test doubles
- YDL (subclass of FakeYDL)
  - Records processed info dicts in downloaded_info_dicts
  - Collects screen/output messages in msgs
  - Ensures the test suite does not invoke real downloads (dl method asserts)
- _make_result(formats, **kwargs)
  - Helper to construct a typical info_dict with:
    - id, title, extractor, webpage_url, and a provided formats list
    - Additional kwargs merged via compat_kwargs for compatibility
- TestFormatSelection
  - Exercises YoutubeIE._sort_formats and various selection rules
  - Tests include:
    - Prefer free formats when available (webm vs mp4) and resolution cases
    - Format selection with format strings (e.g., 20/47, best/bestvideo, etc.)
    - Audio-only selection scenarios (bestaudio, worstaudio) and mixed lists
    - Audio format extensions and bitrate (abr) preferences across ext groups
    - Video selection (bestvideo, worstvideo) and vcodec/acodec constraints
    - String-based format_id matching and operators (e.g., [format_id=abc], [format_id^=abc])
    - Complex YouTube-specific ordering (bestvideo+bestaudio, dash formats, etc.)
    - Incomplete format lists (audio-only or video-only extractors) fallback behavior
    - Edge-case invalid specs and syntax error handling
- TestYoutubeDL
  - Tests around:
    - Subtitles and automatic captions extraction and request shaping
    - add_extra_info: ensures non-destructive merging of extra fields
    - prepare_filename: templating behavior, missing fields handling, placeholders, and formatting (including zero-padding and alignment)
    - _format_note: formatting of bitrate and fps notes
    - Post-processors: a simple post-processor integration with keepvideo flag handling
    - match_filter: filtering logic using custom filters and match_filter_func
    - playlist_items_selection: correct extraction of playlist entries and playlist_item ranges
    - urlopen_no_file_protocol: ensures file:// URLs raise URLError
    - Do not override ie_key in url_transparent chains
    - ignoreerrors with URL-transparent iterable entries in playlists
    - default_times: populating upload_date and release_date from timestamps
- TestYoutubeDLCookies
  - Comprehensive cookie handling tests:
    - Cookie representation utilities: encoding cookies, comparable cookie collections
    - Header cookies: parsing cookies from header, scoping by domain, path, and security attributes
    - Info-json cookies: cookies parsing from info.json outputs
    - add_headers_cookie: applying cookies from cookiejar to output formats and cookies field
  - Ensures compatibility across Python/CookieJar representations and header cookie policy
- Test helpers and environment setup
  - Uses a deliberately scoped TEST_URL = 'http://localhost/sample.mp4'
  - Imports various compat helpers and extractors to simulate real scenarios
  - Utilizes YoutubeIE, InfoExtractor, PostProcessor, and utilities like ExtractorError, match_filter_func, traverse_obj

Main functionality and implementation details covered by tests
- Format selection and sorting
  - YoutubeIE._sort_formats is exercised to ensure formats are ordered for selection based on:
    - ext availability, height/bitrate, vcodec/acodec presence
    - preferences like prefer_free_formats
    - combinations like bestvideo+bestaudio vs best/bestvideo
  - Tests cover:
    - Free formats preference (e.g., webm vs mp4 with same height)
    - Best quality selection across different resolutions and formats
    - Audio vs video focus (bestaudio, bestvideo, best/bestvideo)
    - Aliased or dash formats and constraints (vcodec/acodec, ext)
    - Complex selectors with multiple format types (webm/mp4, mp3/ogg, etc.)
    - Fallback behavior for incomplete format sets (audio-only/video-only extractors)
    - Format filtering with numerical and textual operations (filesize, width, height)
- Subtitles and captions
  - Subtitles dictionaries per language, automatic captions
  - Writes subtitles when requested, choosing appropriate ext and auto vs manual
  - Verification of requested_subtitles and exact mapping by language
  - Extension handling for subtitles (subtitlesformat override)
- Filenames and default format specs
  - prepare_filename and _default_format_spec behavior
  - Handling of missing fields with NA placeholders
  - Placeholder replacements for template fields, including width/height formatting with padding and alignment
  - Special handling for literal percent signs and escaping
  - Default behavior variations when simulate, is_live, or outtmpl conditions change
- Post-processing integration
  - Simple and modifier post-processors run and modify the downloaded file or metadata
  - Proper behavior with keepvideo flag and cleanup of intermediate files
- Match filtering
  - Comprehensive testing of match_filter_func with:
    - numerical comparisons, string equality/inequality
    - existence checks, contains/regex-like operations
    - logical combinations and syntax error handling
- Playlist and URL handling
  - Correct playlist item selection based on playliststart, playlistend, and playlist_items filters
  - Accurate playlist_index metadata when processing entries
  - Handling of url_transparent entries and nested extractor behavior
- Error handling and edge cases
  - Invalid format specs raise SyntaxError
  - Best/worst selections with incompatible or unavailable formats raise ExtractorError as appropriate
  - Edge cases around format availability and width/height constraints
- Cookies and headers
  - CookieJar loading from header cookies and domain/path scoping
  - Handling of unscoped cookies (error paths)
  - Interaction of cookies with http_headers in info dicts and the cookies field
  - Writing and applying cookies across info_dicts and formats
  - Info.json cookies: ensure cookies are preserved, sanitized, and re-applied
  - Ensuring header cookies are not exposed or overridden across different result dicts
- Default times
  - Filling in upload_date and release_date from timestamp and release_timestamp when present
  - Ensuring types are compat_str and date formats are YYYYMMDD
- URL handling and edge interactions
  - urlopen with non-file URLs behaves as expected
  - url_transparent and nested extractor logic does not override ie_key in deceptive or chained extractions

Notes on test design and approach
- Uses a controlled TEST_URL and a test-specific FakeYDL to avoid real network activity
- Builds synthetic InfoDicts with realistic fields required by format selection, subtitles, cookies, and processing
- Covers both common usage scenarios and tricky edge cases (e.g., complex format specs, header cookies, URL transparent chains)
- Emphasizes compatibility with various extractors and the internal format handling logic used by youtube-dl

In short
This file is a comprehensive unit test suite for the core download and format-selection logic of youtube-dl. It validates how formats are chosen under a wide range of conditions (free formats, audio/video distinctions, format specifiers, and filtering), how subtitles and cookies are handled (including headers and info.json cookies), how filenames and default format specs are rendered, how post-processors are integrated, and how playlist and URL-transparent extractor interactions behave. It relies on a test double (YDL) and helper utilities to simulate the downloader environment and capture results for assertion.
