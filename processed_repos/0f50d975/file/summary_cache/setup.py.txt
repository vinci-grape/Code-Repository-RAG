Here is a concise, comprehensive summary of the code in youtube-dl/setup.py:

Overview
- A setup script for the youtube-dl project that supports both traditional source/distribution packaging and Windows executable packaging via py2exe.
- It gracefully handles environments with or without setuptools and adapts to whether py2exe is requested.

Main functionality
- Detects packaging backend availability:
  - Tries to import setuptools; if unavailable, falls back to distutils and notes setuptools_available = False.
  - Attempts to import py2exe; if missing and the user requested py2exe on the command line, it prints an error and exits.
- Version handling:
  - Loads the package version by executing youtube_dl/version.py (without importing the package) to obtain __version__.
- py2exe packaging path:
  - Defines py2exe_options (bundle_files, compression, optimization, dist_dir, and dll_excludes).
  - Sets up py2exe_console with the executable entry using youtube_dl/__main__.py, including version, description, and product details.
  - If the command is py2exe, uses py2exe_params to configure packaging as a Windows executable.
- Standard packaging path (non-py2exe):
  - Prepares data_files for distribution (bash completion, fish completion, README, man page) if those files exist.
  - If any of the data files are missing, issues a warning but continues packaging.
  - Builds a data_files structure mapping directories to present files.
  - If setuptools is available, adds an entry_points entry for console_scripts: youtube-dl = youtube_dl:main.
  - If setuptools is not available, falls back to using scripts: bin/youtube-dl.
- Custom build step:
  - Defines a custom distutils Command named build_lazy_extractors.
  - When run, it executes devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py to generate youtube_dl/extractor/lazy_extractors.py. This is used to lazily load extractors.
- Setup invocation:
  - Metadata: name, version, description, long_description, URL, author/maintainer details, and license (Unlicense).
  - Packages included: youtube_dl, youtube_dl.extractor, youtube_dl.downloader, youtube_dl.postprocessor.
  - Classifiers enumerate broad Python version compatibility (Python 2.x up to 3.x, and multiple implementations) and other metadata like topic and environment.
  - cmdclass includes the custom build_lazy_extractors command.
  - Composed parameters (**params) come from either the py2exe path or the standard packaging path (data_files or console_scripts entry_points, plus possibly scripts).

Key implementation details
- Version retrieval:
  - Uses exec(compile(open('youtube_dl/version.py').read(), 'youtube_dl/version.py', 'exec')) to populate __version__ without importing the package.
- py2exe specifics:
  - py2exe_options includes bundling, compression, optimization, and excludes certain DLLs (w9xpopen.exe, crypt32.dll).
  - py2exe_console points to youtube_dl/__main__.py as the entry script with descriptive fields (description, comments, product_name, product_version).
  - When building with py2exe, the setup uses py2exe_params; otherwise, the normal packaging path is used.
- Data files handling:
  - Checks for the existence of files before including them; missing files trigger warnings suggesting running make to build generated files.
  - Data files are grouped under etc/bash_completion.d, etc/fish/completions, share/doc/youtube_dl, and share/man/man1.
- Entry points vs scripts:
  - If setuptools is available, uses console_scripts entry point so youtube-dl can be executed as a Python script installed by packaging.
  - If setuptools is not available, uses a scripts entry pointing to bin/youtube-dl, maintaining compatibility with older tooling.
- Custom build_lazy_extractors:
  - A dedicated command to prebuild the extractor lazy loading module, executed via Python during the setup process with spawn (ensuring it respects dry_run).
- Package scope:
  - Includes core module and subpackages: youtube_dl, youtube_dl.extractor, youtube_dl.downloader, youtube_dl.postprocessor.
- Licensing and metadata:
  - License set to Unlicense, with authorship and maintainership details included in the setup metadata.

In short, setup.py configures both Windows executable packaging (py2exe) and standard Python packaging, dynamically determines version, conditionally includes data files or console entry points, and adds a custom command to prebuild lazy extractors, all while maintaining compatibility across multiple Python versions and packaging backends.
