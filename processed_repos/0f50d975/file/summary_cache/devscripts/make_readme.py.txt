Concise summary of the code

Purpose
- A Python script that updates the OPTIONS section of README.md by generating it from help text provided on standard input.

Main functionality
- Reads the current README.md and splits it into a header (up to the first “# OPTIONS”) and a footer (from “# CONFIGURATION” to the end).
- Extracts the options block from stdin (help text) by locating the “  General Options:” section, trims and re-formats it, and then rebuilds the README with the updated OPTIONS section in markdown format.
- Writes the resulting content back to README.md using UTF-8 encoding.

Key components and implementation details
- Environment and imports
  - Uses unicode_literals for compatibility.
  - Modifies sys.path to include the repository root so it can import utils.read_file.
  - Imports compat_open from youtube_dl.compat as open for file writing.

- Input handling
  - Reads help text from standard input (sys.stdin).
  - If the input is bytes, decodes it as UTF-8.

- Reading and splitting README
  - Reads README.md via read_file.
  - header = content before the first occurrence of “# OPTIONS”.
  - footer = content from the first occurrence of “# CONFIGURATION” to the end.
  - This preserves the top and bottom parts of the README while replacing the options section.

- Extracting and formatting options
  - Locates the start of the General Options block in the help text using helptext.index('  General Options:') and offsets by +19 to skip the label itself.
  - Transforms lines that begin with two spaces followed by a word line into Markdown headers using a regex: r'(?m)^  (\w.+)$' => r'## \1'.
  - Prepares the final options block with a header line '# OPTIONS' and a trailing newline.

- Writing back
  - Writes the composed content (header + new options block + footer) to README.md with UTF-8 encoding.

Notes and assumptions
- Assumes the README.md contains specific markers: a '# OPTIONS' heading and a '# CONFIGURATION' section to split header and footer. If these markers are missing, the script would raise a ValueError due to index() usage.
- Assumes the help text from stdin includes a properly labeled “  General Options:” section.
- The script is designed for a Python 3 environment (uses encoding parameter in open and explicit decoding of bytes).

In short: it automates regenerating the README’s OPTIONS section from a provided help text, preserving the surrounding README structure and applying a simple formatting rule to convert option lines into Markdown subheaders.
