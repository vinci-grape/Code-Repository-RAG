Concise summary of ./youtube-dl/devscripts/make_supportedsites.py

What it does:
- Generates a Markdown file listing all supported sites (extractors) from youtube-dl.
- Produces a bullet list with each site name in bold, an optional description, and a tag if the siteâ€™s extractor is currently broken.
- Writes the resulting Markdown to a user-specified output file.

Main flow and key pieces:
- Command-line interface:
  - Uses optparse to require a single positional argument OUTFILE.md.
  - Validates that exactly one argument (the output file) is provided.
- Import setup:
  - Adjusts sys.path by inserting the repository root (grandparent of this script) so youtube_dl and a local utils module can be imported.
  - Imports youtube_dl and a write_file utility (from utils).
- gen_ies_md(ies) generator:
  - Iterates over a list of extractor classes (ies).
  - For each extractor (ie):
    - Start with a markdown bold site name: **IE_NAME**.
    - If IE_DESC is False, skip the extractor (do not include it).
    - If IE_DESC is not None, append a description: ": IE_DESC".
    - If the extractor is not working (ie.working() returns False), append " (Currently broken)".
    - Yields the final markdown line for that extractor.
- Collecting extractors:
  - Obtains extractors via youtube_dl.gen_extractors().
  - Sorts them by IE_NAME (case-insensitive).
- Output construction:
  - Builds a markdown document starting with "# Supported sites\n".
  - Appends each generated line as a bullet: " - " + md + "\n".
  - Writes the final string to the specified outfile using write_file(outfile, out).
- Execution:
  - Entrypoint guarded by if __name__ == '__main__': main()

Important implementation details:
- Extraction metadata:
  - IE_NAME: used for display name (bold in Markdown).
  - IE_DESC: optional description; True/False handling:
    - False: skip the extractor entirely.
    - None: no description added.
    - Any other value: appended as the description.
- Status indicator:
  - If an extractor is not working (working() returns False), the line includes " (Currently broken)".
- Ordering:
  - Extractors are sorted alphabetically by IE_NAME (case-insensitive) to produce a stable list.
- Dependencies:
  - Relies on youtube_dl.gen_extractors() API and each extractor exposing IE_NAME, optional IE_DESC, and a working() method.
  - Uses a write_file helper to write the Markdown to disk.

Output:
- A Markdown file with a heading "# Supported sites" and a bullet list of sites in the form:
  - **SiteName**: Description (Currently broken)
  - Entries with IE_DESC set to False are omitted.
