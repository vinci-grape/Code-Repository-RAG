Concise summary of the code

- Purpose
  - Generate a download HTML page by populating a template with the latest version data from versions.json.

- Main functionality
  - Reads update/versions.json to obtain the latest version and its associated download URLs and SHA256 sums.
  - Reads the download.html.in template.
  - Replaces template placeholders with actual values:
    - @PROGRAM_VERSION@ -> latest version string
    - @PROGRAM_URL@, @PROGRAM_SHA256SUM@ -> version['bin'][0], version['bin'][1]
    - @EXE_URL@, @EXE_SHA256SUM@ -> version['exe'][0], version['exe'][1]
    - @TAR_URL@, @TAR_SHA256SUM@ -> version['tar'][0], version['tar'][1]
  - Writes the populated content to download.html.

- Key components
  - sys.path manipulation to import utils from the repository root:
    - Inserts two levels up from the script’s directory into sys.path.
  - utils.read_file and utils.write_file for I/O (abstracted file operations).
  - JSON data structure expectations:
    - update/versions.json contains:
      - latest: string
      - versions: { version: { bin: [url, sha256], exe: [url, sha256], tar: [url, sha256] } }

- Important implementation details
  - Path handling: reads update/versions.json and download.html.in relative to the script’s execution directory, and writes download.html to the same location.
  - Data handling: uses json.loads(read_file(...)) and expects a specific structure for bin, exe, and tar entries.
  - The script is procedural (no classes or functions defined); it runs top-to-bottom when executed.
  - Unicode compatibility is enabled via from __future__ import unicode_literals.

- Output
  - Generates a concrete download.html file with the latest version’s program, EXE, and TAR download links and their SHA256 sums.
