Concise but comprehensive summary of the file

Purpose
- A small maintenance script used in the YouTube-DL repository to update the copyright year in HTML files on the gh-pages branch.

Main functionality
- For every HTML-like file in the current directory (matching *.html*), it updates a copyright line that starts with “Copyright © 2011-” followed by a 4-digit year to extend the range up to the current year.

Key components
- Imports and environment
  - Uses Python 2/3 compatibility helpers via __future__.
  - Reads the current year with datetime.datetime.now().year and converts it to a string using compat_str.
  - Adjusts sys.path to find devscripts.utils and other project modules.

- Core operations
  - glob.glob('*.html*') to list target files in the current directory.
  - read_file(fn) to read file contents.
  - re.sub with pattern (?P<copyright>Copyright © 2011-)(?P<year>[0-9]{4}) to replace the year portion with the current year.
  - If the file’s content changes, writes the updated content to a temporary file named fn + '.part' using write_file, then atomically renames it over the original file with os.rename.

- Regex details
  - Pattern looks specifically for “Copyright © 2011-” followed by exactly four digits.
  - Replaces with “Copyright © 2011-<current_year>”.
  - Uses named groups in the regex, though only the replacement string is used.

- Safety/robustness
  - Only writes back if changes occurred (content != newc).
  - Writes to a temporary file and then renames to minimize partial writes.

Important implementation details
- File discovery is non-recursive and limited to the current working directory.
- The year is derived from the system clock at runtime.
- The replacement is strict: it only updates the suffix that matches the 2011-YYYY pattern; other copyright formats are left untouched.
- Writes rely on project-provided read_file and write_file utilities, which likely handle encoding concerns.
- The script prints no progress or logs; it performs silently unless run with error output.

Overall, a focused utility to keep HTML page copyrights up-to-date through a simple in-place update mechanism.
