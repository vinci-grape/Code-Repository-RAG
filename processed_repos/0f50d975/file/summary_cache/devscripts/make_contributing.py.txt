Summary:
- Purpose: A small CLI utility used in youtube-dl devscripts to generate a contributor-oriented file by extracting specific sections from an input document (typically a README).
- Entry point: main() invoked when the script is run directly.
- Command-line interface:
  - Uses optparse to require two positional arguments: INFILE OUTFILE.
  - Exits with an error message if the argument count is not 2.
- Core functionality:
  - Reads the entire content of INFILE via read_file (from utils).
  - Extracts two sections using regular expressions:
    - bug_text: content between the BUGS section header and the following COPYRIGHT header.
      - Pattern: (?s)#\s*BUGS\s*[^\n]*\s*(.*?)#\s*COPYRIGHT
    - dev_text: content from the DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS header up to the EMBEDDING YOUTUBE-DL header.
      - Pattern: (?s)(#\s*DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS.*?)#\s*EMBEDDING YOUTUBE-DL
  - Concatenates bug_text and dev_text and writes the result to OUTFILE via write_file.
- Implementation notes:
  - Uses inline DOTALL (?s) so newlines are included in matches.
  - Both extractions rely on the existence of the specific headers; if a match fails, .group(1) will raise an exception (no explicit error handling for missing sections).
  - The script does not modify or include headers beyond the captured contents; it outputs exactly bug_text + dev_text.
  - Compatible with Python 2/3 style (unicode_literals imported, but uses optparse which is deprecated in Python 3+).
- Dependencies: read_file and write_file from utils (not shown in this file).
