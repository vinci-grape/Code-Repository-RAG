Summary:
- Purpose: This file serves as an empty package initializer for the devscripts package inside youtube-dl. It ensures that the devscripts subpackage (and its modules like devscripts.utils) can be imported from outside.
- Content: A single comment indicating the reason for the empty file; no code, classes, or functions.
- Details: In Python, __init__.py marks a directory as a package. Since this file contains no initialization logic, importing devscripts.utils relies on the package being recognized, but has no side effects or runtime behavior beyond enabling the import.
