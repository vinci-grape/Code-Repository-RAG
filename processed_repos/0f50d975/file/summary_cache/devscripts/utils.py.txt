Concise summary:

Purpose
- A small collection of utility helpers used by Youtube-DL dev scripts. It provides file I/O helpers, version extraction, CLI argument parsing for filenames, a simple function-composition utility, and a safe wrapper around subprocess execution with sensible defaults.

Main components and behavior

- Environment setup
  - Adjusts sys.path to include the project root so it can import youtube_dl.compat.
  - Imports compat_kwargs and compat_open (aliased as open) to handle Python 2/3 compatibility for keyword arguments and file I/O.

- read_file(fname)
  - Reads and returns the contents of a file as a UTF-8 string using the compatibility-enabled open.

- write_file(fname, content, mode='w')
  - Writes content to a file in UTF-8 encoding (default mode 'w').
  - Returns the number of characters written (as per file.write).

- read_version(fname='youtube_dl/version.py')
  - Reads the version string without importing the package.
  - Executes the contents of the given version file in a controlled namespace and returns the value of __version__ from locals().

- get_filename_args(has_infile=False, default_outfile=None)
  - Builds and parses a small CLI to obtain an input file and an output file.
  - If has_infile is True, returns a tuple (infile, outfile); otherwise returns just outfile.
  - If default_outfile is provided, outfile becomes an optional argument with that default via compat_kwargs; otherwise outfile is required.
  - Uses argparse and compat_kwargs for cross-version compatibility.

- compose_functions(*functions)
  - Returns a function that applies the provided functions in sequence to an input.
  - Implementation uses functools.reduce with the pattern: lambda y, f: f(y) starting from the initial value.

- run_process(*args, **kwargs)
  - Convenience wrapper around subprocess.run with sane defaults:
    - text defaults to True
    - check defaults to True
    - capture_output defaults to True
  - If text mode is enabled, ensures encoding='utf-8' and errors='replace'.
  - Applies compat_kwargs to the keyword arguments for cross-version compatibility.
  - Executes and returns the CompletedProcess object.

Key implementation details

- Cross-version compatibility
  - Uses youtube_dl.compat to normalize keyword arguments and file I/O across Python 2/3 environments.
  - The compat_open alias ensures file I/O supports encoding in a cross-version manner.

- Version extraction without import
  - read_version avoids importing the package by executing the version file's code in a localized namespace and reading __version__.

- CLI argument handling
  - get_filename_args is designed to support scripts that either require an infile and compute an outfile, or only require an outfile (with an optional default).

- Function composition utility
  - compose_functions provides a straightforward left-to-right pipeline (x -> f1(x) -> f2(...) ...).

Overall, the module offers lightweight, reusable utilities intended for dev scripts in youtube-dl, with careful attention to cross-version compatibility and UTF-8 handling.
